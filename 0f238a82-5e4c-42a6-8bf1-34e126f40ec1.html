PREFACE

The study of real analysis is indispensable for a prospective graduate student of pure or
applied mathematics. It also has great value for any student who wishes to go beyond the
routine manipulations of formulas because it develops the ability to think deductively,
analyze mathematical situations and extend ideas to new contexts. Mathematics has
become valuable in many areas, including economics and management science as well
as the physical sciences, engineering, and computer science. This book was written to
provide an accessible, reasonably paced treatment of the basic concepts and techniques of
real analysis for students in these areas. While students will find this book challenging,
experience has demonstrated that serious students are fully capable of mastering the
material.
The first three editions were very well received and this edition maintains the same
spirit and user-friendly approach as earlier editions. Every section has been examined.
Some sections have been revised, new examples and exercises have been added, and a new
section on the Darboux approach to the integral has been added to Chapter 7. There is more
material than can be covered in a semester and instructors will need to make selections and
perhaps use certain topics as honors or extra credit projects.
To provide some help for students in analyzing proofs of theorems, there is an
appendix on ‘‘Logic and Proofs’’ that discusses topics such as implications, negations,
contrapositives, and different types of proofs. However, it is a more useful experience to
learn how to construct proofs by first watching and then doing than by reading about
techniques of proof.
Results and proofs are given at a medium level of generality. For instance, continuous
functions on closed, bounded intervals are studied in detail, but the proofs can be readily
adapted to a more general situation. This approach is used to advantage in Chapter 11
where topological concepts are discussed. There are a large number of examples to
illustrate the concepts, and extensive lists of exercises to challenge students and to aid them
in understanding the significance of the theorems.
Chapter 1 has a brief summary of the notions and notations for sets and functions that
will be used. A discussion of Mathematical Induction is given, since inductive proofs arise
frequently. There is also a section on finite, countable and infinite sets. This chapter can
used to provide some practice in proofs, or covered quickly, or used as background material
and returning later as necessary.
Chapter 2 presents the properties of the real number system. The first two sections deal
with Algebraic and Order properties, and the crucial Completeness Property is given in
Section 2.3 as the Supremum Property. Its ramifications are discussed throughout the
remainder of the chapter.
In Chapter 3, a thorough treatment of sequences is given, along with the associated
limit concepts. The material is of the greatest importance. Students find it rather natural
though it takes time for them to become accustomed to the use of epsilon. A brief
introduction to Infinite Series is given in Section 3.7, with more advanced material
presented in Chapter 9.

PREFACE

Chapter 4 on limits of functions and Chapter 5 on continuous functions constitute the
heart of the book. The discussion of limits and continuity relies heavily on the use of
sequences, and the closely parallel approach of these chapters reinforces the understanding
of these essential topics. The fundamental properties of continuous functions on intervals
are discussed in Sections 5.3 and 5.4. The notion of a gauge is introduced in Section 5.5 and
used to give alternate proofs of these theorems. Monotone functions are discussed in
Section 5.6.
The basic theory of the derivative is given in the first part of Chapter 6. This material is
standard, except a result of Carath#eodory is used to give simpler proofs of the Chain Rule
and the Inversion Theorem. The remainder of the chapter consists of applications of the
Mean Value Theorem and may be explored as time permits.
In Chapter 7, the Riemann integral is defined in Section 7.1 as a limit of Riemann
sums. This has the advantage that it is consistent with the students’ first exposure to the
integral in calculus, and since it is not dependent on order properties, it permits immediate
generalization to complex- and vector-values functions that students may encounter in later
courses. It is also consistent with the generalized Riemann integral that is discussed in
Chapter 10. Sections 7.2 and 7.3 develop properties of the integral and establish the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The new Section 7.4, added in response to requests
from a number of instructors, develops the Darboux approach to the integral in terms of
upper and lower integrals, and the connection between the two definitions of the integral is
established. Section 7.5 gives a brief discussion of numerical methods of calculating the
integral of continuous functions.
Sequences of functions and uniform convergence are discussed in the first two sections
of Chapter 8, and the basic transcendental functions are put on a firm foundation in
Sections 8.3 and 8.4. Chapter 9 completes the discussion of infinite series that was begun
in Section 3.7. Chapters 8 and 9 are intrinsically important, and they also show how the
material in the earlier chapters can be applied.
Chapter 10 is a presentation of the generalized Riemann integral (sometimes called the
‘‘Henstock-Kurzweil’’ or the ‘‘gauge’’ integral). It will be new to many readers and they
will be amazed that such an apparently minor modification of the definition of the Riemann
integral can lead to an integral that is more general than the Lebesgue integral. This
relatively new approach to integration theory is both accessible and exciting to anyone who
has studied the basic Riemann integral.
Chapter 11 deals with topological concepts. Earlier theorems and proofs are extended
to a more abstract setting. For example, the concept of compactness is given proper
emphasis and metric spaces are introduced. This chapter will be useful to students
continuing on to graduate courses in mathematics.
There are lengthy lists of exercises, some easy and some challenging, and ‘‘hints’’ to
many of them are provided to help students get started or to check their answers. More
complete solutions of almost every exercise are given in a separate Instructor’s Manual,
which is available to teachers upon request to the publisher.
It is a satisfying experience to see how the mathematical maturity of the students
increases as they gradually learn to work comfortably with concepts that initially seemed
so mysterious. But there is no doubt that a lot of hard work is required on the part of both the
students and the teachers.
Brief biographical sketches of some famous mathematicians are included to enrich the
historical perspective of the book. Thanks go to Dr. Patrick Muldowney for his photograph
of Professors Henstock and Kurzweil, and to John Wiley &amp; Sons for obtaining portraits of
the other mathematicians.

CHAPTER 1

PRELIMINARIES

In this initial chapter we will present the background needed for the study of real
analysis. Section 1.1 consists of a brief survey of set operations and functions, two vital
tools for all of mathematics. In it we establish the notation and state the basic
definitions and properties that will be used throughout the book. We will regard the
word ‘‘set’’ as synonymous with the words ‘‘class,’’ ‘‘collection,’’ and ‘‘family,’’ and
we will not define these terms or give a list of axioms for set theory. This approach,
often referred to as ‘‘naive’’ set theory, is quite adequate for working with sets in the
context of real analysis.
Section 1.2 is concerned with a special method of proof called Mathematical
Induction. It is related to the fundamental properties of the natural number system and,
though it is restricted to proving particular types of statements, it is important and used
frequently. An informal discussion of the different types of proofs that are used in
mathematics, such as contrapositives and proofs by contradiction, can be found in
Appendix A.
In Section 1.3 we apply some of the tools presented in the first two sections of this
chapter to a discussion of what it means for a set to be finite or infinite. Careful definitions
are given and some basic consequences of these definitions are derived. The important
result that the set of rational numbers is countably infinite is established.
In addition to introducing basic concepts and establishing terminology and notation,
this chapter also provides the reader with some initial experience in working with precise
definitions and writing proofs. The careful study of real analysis unavoidably entails the
reading and writing of proofs, and like any skill, it is necessary to practice. This chapter is a
starting point.

Section 1.1 Sets and Functions
To the reader: In this section we give a brief review of the terminology and notation that
will be used in this text. We suggest that you look through it quickly and come back later
when you need to recall the meaning of a term or a symbol.
If an element x is in a set A, we write
x2A
and say that x is a member of A, or that x belongs to A. If x is not in A, we write
x2
= A:
If every element of a set A also belongs to a set B, we say that A is a subset of B and write
A#B

or B # A:

CHAPTER 1 PRELIMINARIES

We say that a set A is a proper subset of a set B if A # B, but there is at least one element of
B that is not in A. In this case we sometimes write
A # B:
1.1.1 Definition Two sets A and B are said to be equal, and we write A ¼ B, if they
contain the same elements.
Thus, to prove that the sets A and B are equal, we must show that
A#B

and

B # A:

A set is normally defined by either listing its elements explicitly, or by specifying a
property that determines the elements of the set. If P denotes a property that is meaningful
and unambiguous for elements of a set S, then we write
fx 2 S : PðxÞg
for the set of all elements x in S for which the property P is true. If the set S is understood
from the context, then it is often omitted in this notation.
Several special sets are used throughout this book, and they are denoted by standard
symbols. (We will use the symbol :¼ to mean that the symbol on the left is being defined
by the symbol on the right.)

real numbers R.

The set R of real numbers is of fundamental importance and will be discussed at length
in Chapter 2.
1.1.2 Examples (a) The set
#

x 2 N : x2 # 3x þ 2 ¼ 0

#

consists of those natural numbers satisfying the stated equation. Since the only solutions of
this quadratic equation are x ¼ 1 and x ¼ 2, we can denote this set more simply by {1, 2}.
(b) A natural number n is even if it has the form n ¼ 2k for some k 2 N. The set of even
natural numbers can be written
f2k : k 2 N g;
which is less cumbersome than fn 2 N : n ¼ 2k; k 2 N g. Similarly, the set of odd natural
numbers can be written
f2k # 1 : k 2 N g:

&amp;

Set Operations
We now define the methods of obtaining new sets from given ones. Note that these set
operations are based on the meaning of the words ‘‘or,’’ ‘‘and,’’ and ‘‘not.’’ For the union, it
is important to be aware of the fact that the word ‘‘or’’ is used in the inclusive sense,
allowing the possibility that x may belong to both sets. In legal terminology, this inclusive
sense is sometimes indicated by ‘‘and/or.’’

1.1.3 Definition (a) The union of sets A and B is the set
A [ B :¼ fx : x 2 A or x 2 Bg:
(b) The intersection of the sets A and B is the set
A \ B :¼ fx : x 2 A and x 2 Bg:
(c) The complement of B relative to A is the set
AnB :¼ fx : x 2 A and x 2
= Bg:

Figure 1.1.1

(a) A [ B

(b) A \ B

(c) AnB

The set that has no elements is called the empty set and is denoted by the symbol ;.
Two sets A and B are said to be disjoint if they have no elements in common; this can be
expressed by writing A \ B ¼ ;.
To illustrate the method of proving set equalities, we will next establish one of the
De Morgan laws for three sets. The proof of the other one is left as an exercise.
1.1.4 Theorem If A, B, C are sets, then
(a) AnðB [ C Þ ¼ ðAnBÞ \ ðAnC Þ,
(b) AnðB \ C Þ ¼ ðAnBÞ [ ðAnC Þ.
Proof. To prove (a), we will show that every element in AnðB [ C Þ is contained in both
(AnB) and (AnC), and conversely.
If x is in AnðB [ CÞ, then x is in A, but x is not in B [ C. Hence x is in A, but x is neither
in B nor in C. Therefore, x is in A but not B, and x is in A but not C. Thus, x 2 AnB and
x 2 AnC, which shows that x 2 ðAnBÞ \ ðAnC Þ.
Conversely, if x 2 ðAnBÞ \ ðAnCÞ, then x 2 ðAnBÞ and x 2 ðAnCÞ. Hence x 2 A and
both x 2
= B and x 2
= C. Therefore, x 2 A and x 2
= ðB [ CÞ, so that x 2 AnðB [ C Þ.
Since the sets ðAnBÞ \ ðAnC Þ and AnðB [ C Þ contain the same elements, they are
equal by Definition 1.1.1.
Q.E.D.
There are times when it is desirable to form unions and intersections of more than two
sets. For a finite collection of sets {A1, A2, . . . , An}, their union is the set A consisting of
all elements that belong to at least one of the sets Ak, and their intersection consists of all
elements that belong to all of the sets Ak.
This is extended to an infinite collection of sets {A1, A2, . . . , An, . . . } as follows.
Their union is the set of elements that belong to at least one of the sets An. In this case we
write
1
[
An :¼ fx : x 2 An for some n 2 N g:
n¼1


C01

12/08/2010

12:3:16

Page 4

CHAPTER 1 PRELIMINARIES

Similarly, their intersection is the set of elements that belong to all of these sets An. In this
case we write
1
\

An :¼ fx : x 2 An for all n 2 N g:

n¼1

Functions
In order to discuss functions, we define the Cartesian product of two sets.
1.1.5 Definition If A and B are nonempty sets, then the Cartesian product A # B of A
and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) with a 2 A and b 2 B. That is,
A # B :¼ fða; bÞ : a 2 A; b 2 Bg:
Thus if A ¼ {1, 2, 3} and B ¼ {1, 5}, then the set A # B is the set whose elements are
the ordered pairs
ð1; 1Þ;

ð1; 5Þ;

ð2; 1Þ;

ð2; 5Þ;

ð3; 1Þ;

ð3; 5Þ:

We may visualize the set A # B as the set of six points in the plane with the coordinates that
we have just listed.
We often draw a diagram (such as Figure 1.1.2) to indicate the Cartesian product of
two sets A and B. However, it should be realized that this diagram may be a simplification.
For example, if A :¼ fx 2 R : 1 # x # 2g and B :¼ fy 2 R : 0 # y # 1 or 2 # y # 3g,
then instead of a rectangle, we should have a drawing such as Figure 1.1.3.

Figure 1.1.2

Figure 1.1.3

We will now discuss the fundamental notion of a function or a mapping.
To the mathematician of the early nineteenth century, the word ‘‘function’’ meant a
definite formula, such as f ðxÞ :¼ x2 þ 3x # 5, which associates to each real number x
another number f (x). (Here, f (0) ¼ #5, f (1) ¼ #1, f (5) ¼ 35.) This understanding
excluded the case of different formulas on different intervals, so that functions could not be
defined ‘‘in pieces.’’
As mathematics developed, it became clear that a more general definition of
‘‘function’’ would be useful. It also became evident that it is important to make a clear
distinction between the function itself and the values of the function. A revised definition
might be:


C01

12/08/2010

12:3:17

Page 5

1.1 SETS AND FUNCTIONS

5

A function f from a set A into a set B is a rule of correspondence that assigns to
each element x in A a uniquely determined element f (x) in B.
But however suggestive this revised definition might be, there is the difficulty of
interpreting the phrase ‘‘rule of correspondence.’’ In order to clarify this, we will express
the definition entirely in terms of sets; in effect, we will define a function to be its graph.
While this has the disadvantage of being somewhat artificial, it has the advantage of being
unambiguous and clearer.
1.1.6 Definition Let A and B be sets. Then a function from A to B is a set f of ordered
pairs in A # B such that for each a 2 A there exists a unique b 2 B with (a, b) 2 f. (In other
words, if (a, b) 2 f and (a, b0 ) 2 f, then b ¼ b0 .)
The set A of first elements of a function f is called the domain of f and is often denoted
by D( f ). The set of all second elements in f is called the range of f and is often denoted by
R( f ). Note that, although D( f ) ¼ A, we only have Rðf Þ # B. (See Figure 1.1.4.)
The essential condition that:
ða; bÞ 2 f

and

ða; b0 Þ 2 f

implies that

b ¼ b0

is sometimes called the vertical line test. In geometrical terms it says every vertical line
x ¼ a with a 2 A intersects the graph of f exactly once.
The notation
f :A!B
is often used to indicate that f is a function from A into B. We will also say that f is a
mapping of A into B, or that f maps A into B. If (a, b) is an element in f, it is customary to
write
b ¼ f ð aÞ

or sometimes

Figure 1.1.4

a 7! b:

A function as a graph

If b ¼ f (a), we often refer to b as the value of f at a, or as the image of a under f.
Transformations and Machines
Aside from using graphs, we can visualize a function as a transformation of the set D( f ) ¼
A into the set Rðf Þ # B. In this phraseology, when (a, b) 2 f, we think of f as taking the

element a from A and ‘‘transforming’’ or ‘‘mapping’’ it into an element b ¼ f (a) in
Rðf Þ # B. We often draw a diagram, such as Figure 1.1.5, even when the sets A and B are
not subsets of the plane.

There is another way of visualizing a function: namely, as a machine that accepts
elements of D( f ) ¼ A as inputs and produces corresponding elements of Rðf Þ # B as outputs.
If we take an element x 2 D( f ) and put it into f, then out comes the corresponding value f (x).
If we put a different element y 2 D( f ) into f, then out comes f (y), which may or may not differ
from f (x). If we try to insert something that does not belong to D( f ) into f, we find that it is not
accepted, for f can operate only on elements from D( f ). (See Figure 1.1.6.)

Figure 1.1.6

A function as a machine

This last visualization makes clear the distinction between f and f (x): the first is the
machine itself, and the second is the output of the machine f when x is the input. Whereas
no one is likely to confuse a meat grinder with ground meat, enough people have confused
functions with their values that it is worth distinguishing between them notationally.
Direct and Inverse Images
Let f : A ! B be a function with domain D( f ) ¼ A and range Rðf Þ # B.
1.1.7 Definition If E is a subset of A, then the direct image of E under f is the subset f (E)
of B given by
f ðEÞ :¼ ff ðxÞ : x 2 Eg:

If H is a subset of B, then the inverse image of H under f is the subset f #1(H) of A given by
f

#1

ðHÞ :¼ fx 2 A : f ðxÞ 2 H g:

Remark The notation f #1(H) used in this connection has its disadvantages. However, we
will use it since it is the standard notation.
Thus, if we are given a set E # A, then a point y1 2 B is in the direct image f (E) if and
only if there exists at least one point x1 2 E such that y1 ¼ f (x1). Similarly, given a set
H # B, then a point x2 is in the inverse image f #1(H) if and only if y2 :¼ f (x2) belongs to H.
(See Figure 1.1.7.)

Figure 1.1.7

Direct and inverse images

1.1.8 Examples (a) Let f : R ! R be defined by f (x) :¼ x2. Then the direct image of
the set E :¼ fx : 0 # x # 2g is the set f ðEÞ ¼ fy : 0 # y # 4g.
If G :¼ fy : 0 # y # 4g, then the inverse image of G is the set f #1 ðGÞ ¼ fx : #2 #
x # 2g. Thus, in this case, we see# that f #1# ðf ðEÞÞ 6¼ E.
#1
On
other
# the
# hand, we have f f ðGÞ ¼ G. But if H :¼ fy : #1 # y # 1g, then we
#1
have f f ðH Þ ¼ fy : 0 # y # 1g 6¼ H.
A sketch of the graph of f may help to visualize these sets.
(b) Let f : A ! B, and let G, H be subsets of B. We will show that
f

#1

ðG \ H Þ # f

#1

ðGÞ \ f

#1

ðH Þ:

#1

For, if x 2 f ðG \ H Þ, then f ðxÞ 2 G \ H, so that f (x) 2 G and f (x) 2 H. But this implies
that x 2 f #1 ðGÞ and x 2 f #1 ðH Þ, whence x 2 f #1 ðGÞ \ f #1 ðH Þ. Thus the stated implication is proved. [The opposite inclusion is also true, so that we actually have set equality
between these sets; see Exercise 15.]
&amp;
Further facts about direct and inverse images are given in the exercises.
Special Types of Functions
The following definitions identify some very important types of functions.
1.1.9 Definition Let f : A ! B be a function from A to B.
(a) The function f is said to be injective (or to be one-one) if whenever x1 6¼ x2, then
f ðx1 Þ 6¼ f ðx2 Þ. If f is an injective function, we also say that f is an injection.
(b) The function f is said to be surjective (or to map A onto B) if f (A) ¼ B; that is, if the
range R( f ) ¼ B. If f is a surjective function, we also say that f is a surjection.

CHAPTER 1 PRELIMINARIES

(c) If f is both injective and surjective, then f is said to be bijective. If f is bijective, we
also say that f is a bijection.
#

In order to prove that a function f is injective, we must establish that:
for all x1 ; x2 in A; if f ðx1 Þ ¼ f ðx2 Þ; then x1 ¼ x2 :

To do this we assume that f (x1) ¼ f (x2) and show that x1 ¼ x2.
[In other words, the graph of f satisfies the first horizontal line test: Every horizontal line
y ¼ b with b 2 B intersects the graph f in at most one point.]
# To prove that a function f is surjective, we must show that for any b 2 B there exists at
least one x 2 A such that f (x) ¼ b.
[In other words, the graph of f satisfies the second horizontal line test: Every horizontal
line y ¼ b with b 2 B intersects the graph f in at least one point.]
1.1.10 Example Let A :¼ fx 2 R : x 6¼ 1g and define f ðxÞ :¼ 2x=ðx # 1Þ for all x 2 A.
To show that f is injective, we take x1 and x2 in A and assume that f (x1) ¼ f (x2). Thus we
have
2x1
2x2
¼
;
x1 # 1 x2 # 1
which implies that x1 ðx2 # 1Þ ¼ x2 ðx1 # 1Þ, and hence x1 ¼ x2. Therefore f is injective.
To determine the range of f, we solve the equation y ¼ 2x=ðx # 1Þ for x in terms of y.
We obtain x ¼ y=ðy # 2Þ, which is meaningful for y 6¼ 2. Thus the range of f is the set
&amp;
B :¼ fy 2 R : y 6¼ 2g. Thus, f is a bijection of A onto B.
Inverse Functions
If f is a function from A into B, then f is a special subset of A # B (namely, one passing the
vertical line test.) The set of ordered pairs in B # A obtained by interchanging the members
of ordered pairs in f is not generally a function. (That is, the set f may not pass both of the
horizontal line tests.) However, if f is a bijection, then this interchange does lead to a
function, called the ‘‘inverse function’’ of f.
1.1.11 Definition If f : A ! B is a bijection of A onto B, then
g :¼ fðb; aÞ 2 B # A : ða; bÞ 2 f g
is a function on B into A. This function is called the inverse function of f, and is denoted
by f #1. The function f #1 is also called the inverse of f.
We can also express the connection between f and its inverse f #1 by noting that
D( f ) ¼ R( f #1) and R( f ) ¼ D( f #1) and that
b ¼ f ðaÞ

if and only if

a¼f

For example, we saw in Example 1.1.10 that the function

x#1

is a bijection of A :¼ fx 2 R : x 6¼ 1g onto the set B :¼ fy 2 R : y 6¼ 2g. Solving y ¼ f(x)
for x in terms of y, we find the function inverse to f is given by

Remark We introduced the notation f #1(H) in Definition 1.1.7. It makes sense even if f
does not have an inverse function. However, if the inverse function f #1 does exist, then
f #1(H) is the direct image of the set H # B under f #1.

Composition of Functions
It often happens that we want to ‘‘compose’’ two functions f, g by first finding f (x) and then
applying g to get g ( f (x)); however, this is possible only when f(x) belongs to the domain of
g. In order to be able to do this for all f (x), we must assume that the range of f is contained
in the domain of g. (See Figure 1.1.8.)

Figure 1.1.8

The composition of f and g

1.1.12 Definition If f : A ! B and g : B ! C, and if Rðf Þ # DðgÞ ¼ B, then the
composite function g f (note the order!) is the function from A into C defined by
ðg f ÞðxÞ :¼ gðf ðxÞÞ for all

x 2 A:

1.1.13 Examples (a) The order of the composition must be carefully noted. For, let f
and g be the functions whose values at x 2 R are given by
f ðxÞ :¼ 2x

and

gðxÞ :¼ 3x2 # 1:

Since DðgÞ ¼ R and Rðf Þ # R ¼ DðgÞ, then the domain D(g f ) is also equal to R, and the
composite function g f is given by
ðg f ÞðxÞ ¼ 3ð2xÞ2 # 1 ¼ 12x2 # 1:
On the other hand, the domain of the composite function f g is also R, but
#
#
ð f gÞðxÞ ¼ 2 3x2 # 1 ¼ 6x2 # 2:
Thus, in this case, we have g f 6¼ f g.
(b) In considering g f, some care must be exercised to be sure that the range of f is
contained in the domain of g. For example, if
pﬃﬃﬃ
and
gðxÞ :¼ x ;
f ðxÞ :¼ 1 # x2
then, since DðgÞ ¼ fx : x

0g, the composite function g
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ðg f ÞðxÞ ¼ 1 # x2

only for x 2 Dðf Þ that satisfy f (x)

f is given by the formula

0; that is, for x satisfying #1 # x # 1.

CHAPTER 1 PRELIMINARIES

We note that if we reverse the order, then the composition f g is given by the formula
ðf

gÞðxÞ ¼ 1 # x;

but only for those x in the domain DðgÞ ¼ fx : x

0g.

&amp;

We now give the relationship between composite functions and inverse images. The
proof is left as an instructive exercise.
1.1.14 Theorem Let f : A ! B and g : B ! C be functions and let H be a subset of C.
Then we have
#
#
ðg f Þ#1 ðH Þ ¼ f #1 g#1 ðH Þ :
Note the reversal in the order of the functions.
Restrictions of Functions
If f : A ! B is a function and if A1 # A, we can define a function f1: A1 ! B by
f 1 ðxÞ :¼ f ðxÞ

for

x 2 A1 :

The function f1 is called the restriction of f to A1. Sometimes it is denoted by f 1 ¼ f jA1.
It may seem strange to the reader that one would ever choose to throw away a part of a
function, but there are some good reasons for doing so. For example, if f : R ! R is the
squaring function:
f ðxÞ :¼ x2

for

x 2 R;

then f is not injective, so it cannot have an inverse function. However, if we restrict f to the set
A1 :¼ fx : x 0g, then the restriction f jA1 is a bijection of A1 onto A1. Therefore, this
restriction has an inverse function, which is the positive square root function. (Sketch a
graph.)
Similarly, the trigonometric functions S(x) :¼ sin x and C(x) :¼ cos x are not injective on
all of R. However, by making suitable restrictions of these functions, one can obtain the inverse
sine and the inverse cosine functions that the reader has undoubtedly already encountered.

CHAPTER 1 PRELIMINARIES

Section 1.2 Mathematical Induction
Mathematical Induction is a powerful method of proof that is frequently used to establish
the validity of statements that are given in terms of the natural numbers. Although its utility
is restricted to this rather special context, Mathematical Induction is an indispensable tool
in all branches of mathematics. Since many induction proofs follow the same formal lines
of argument, we will often state only that a result follows from Mathematical Induction and
leave it to the reader to provide the necessary details. In this section, we will state the
principle and give several examples to illustrate how inductive proofs proceed.
We shall assume familiarity with the set of natural numbers:
N ¼ f1; 2; 3; . . .g;
with the usual arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication, and with the meaning
of a natural number being less than another one. We will also assume the following
fundamental property of N.
1.2.1 Well-Ordering Property of N

Every nonempty subset of N has a least element.

A more detailed statement of this property is as follows: If S is a subset of N and if
S 6¼ ;, then there exists m 2 S such that m # k for all k 2 S.
On the basis of the Well-Ordering Property, we shall derive a version of the Principle
of Mathematical Induction that is expressed in terms of subsets of N.
1.2.2 Principle of Mathematical Induction Let S be a subset of N that possesses the
two properties:
(1) The number 1 2 S.
(2) For every k 2 N, if k 2 S, then k þ 1 2 S.
Then we have S ¼ N.
Proof. Suppose to the contrary that S 6¼ N. Then the set NnS is not empty, so by the WellOrdering Principle it has a least element m. Since 1 2 S by hypothesis (1), we know that
m &gt; 1. But this implies that m # 1 is also a natural number. Since m # 1 &lt; m and since m is
the least element in N such that m 2
= S, we conclude that m # 1 2 S.
We now apply hypothesis (2) to the element k :¼ m # 1 in S, to infer that k þ 1 ¼
ðm # 1Þ þ 1 ¼ m belongs to S. But this statement contradicts the fact that m 2
= S. Since m
was obtained from the assumption that NnS is not empty, we have obtained a contradiction.
Therefore we must have S ¼ N.
Q.E.D.
The Principle of Mathematical Induction is often set forth in the framework of
statements about natural numbers. If P(n) is a meaningful statement about n 2 N, then P(n)
may be true for some values of n and false for others. For example, if P1(n) is the statement:
‘‘n2 ¼ n,’’ then P1(1) is true while P1(n) is false for all n &gt; 1, n 2 N. On the other hand, if
P2(n) is the statement: ‘‘n2 &gt; 1,’’ then P2(1) is false, while P2(n) is true for all n &gt; 1.
In this context, the Principle of Mathematical Induction can be formulated as follows.
For each n 2 N , let P(n) be a statement about n. Suppose that:
(10 ) P(1) is true.
(20 ) For every k 2 N , if P(k) is true, then P(k þ 1) is true.
Then P(n) is true for all n 2 N.

1.2 MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION

13

The connection with the preceding version of Mathematical Induction, given in 1.2.2,
is made by letting S :¼ fn 2 N : PðnÞ is trueg. Then the conditions (1) and (2) of 1.2.2
correspond exactly to the conditions (10 ) and (20 ), respectively. The conclusion that S ¼ N
in 1.2.2 corresponds to the conclusion that P(n) is true for all n 2 N.
In (20 ) the assumption ‘‘if P(k) is true’’ is called the induction hypothesis. In
establishing (20 ), we are not concerned with the actual truth or falsity of P(k), but only
with the validity of the implication ‘‘if P(k), then P(k þ 1).’’ For example, if we
consider the statements P(n): ‘‘n ¼ n þ 5,’’ then (20 ) is logically correct, for we can
simply add 1 to both sides of P(k) to obtain P(k þ 1). However, since the statement
P(1): ‘‘1 ¼ 6’’ is false, we cannot use Mathematical Induction to conclude that n ¼ n þ 5
for all n 2 N.
It may happen that statements P(n) are false for certain natural numbers but then are
true for all n n0 for some particular n0. The Principle of Mathematical Induction can be
modified to deal with this situation. We will formulate the modified principle, but leave its
verification as an exercise. (See Exercise 12.)
1.2.3 Principle of Mathematical Induction (second version) Let n0 2 N and let P(n)
be a statement for each natural number n n0. Suppose that:
(1) The statement P(n0) is true.
(2) For all k n0, the truth of P(k) implies the truth of P(k þ 1).
Then P(n) is true for all n

n 0.

Sometimes the number n0 in (1) is called the base, since it serves as the starting point,
and the implication in (2), which can be written PðkÞ ) Pðk þ 1Þ, is called the bridge,
since it connects the case k to the case k þ 1.
The following examples illustrate how Mathematical Induction is used to prove
assertions about natural numbers.
1.2.4 Examples (a) For each n 2 N, the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by
1þ2þ

þ n ¼ 12 nðn þ 1Þ:

To prove this formula, we let S be the set of all n 2 N for which the formula is true.
We must verify that conditions (1) and (2) of 1.2.2 are satisfied. If n ¼ 1, then we have
1 ¼ 12 1 ð1 þ 1Þ so that 1 2 S, and (1) is satisfied. Next, we assume that k 2 S and wish to
infer from this assumption that k þ 1 2 S. Indeed, if k 2 S, then
1þ2þ

þ k ¼ 12 kðk þ 1Þ:

If we add k þ 1 to both sides of the assumed equality, we obtain
1þ2þ

þ k þ ðk þ 1Þ¼ 12 kðk þ 1Þ þ ðk þ 1Þ
¼ 12 ðk þ 1Þðk þ 2Þ:

Since this is the stated formula for n ¼ k þ 1, we conclude that k þ 1 2 S. Therefore,
condition (2) of 1.2.2 is satisfied. Consequently, by the Principle of Mathematical
Induction, we infer that S ¼ N, so the formula holds for all n 2 N.
(b) For each n 2 N, the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers is given by
12 þ 22 þ

þ n2 ¼ 16 nðn þ 1Þð2n þ 1Þ:


C01

12/08/2010

12:3:24

14

Page 14

CHAPTER 1 PRELIMINARIES

To establish this formula, we note that it is true for n ¼ 1, since 12 ¼ 16 1 2 3. If we
assume it is true for k, then adding (k þ 1)2 to both sides of the assumed formula gives
12 þ 22 þ

þ k2 þ ðk þ 1Þ2 ¼ 16 kðk þ 1Þð2k þ 1Þ þ ðk þ 1Þ2
#
#
¼ 16 ðk þ 1Þ 2k2 þ k þ 6k þ 6
¼ 16 ðk þ 1Þðk þ 2Þð2k þ 3Þ:

Consequently, the formula is valid for all n 2 N.
(c) Given two real numbers a and b, we will prove that a # b is a factor of an # bn for all
n 2 N.
First we see that the statement is clearly true for n ¼ 1. If we now assume that a # b is a
factor of ak # bk, then
akþ1 # bkþ1 ¼ akþ1 # abk þ abk # bkþ1
#
#
¼ a ak # bk þ bk ða # bÞ:
By the induction hypothesis, a # b is a factor of a (ak # bk) and it is plainly a factor of
bk(a # b). Therefore, a # b is a factor of akþ1 # bkþl, and it follows from Mathematical
Induction that a # b is a factor of an # bn for all n 2 N.
A variety of divisibility results can be derived from this fact. For example, since
11 # 7 ¼ 4, we see that 11n # 7n is divisible by 4 for all n 2 N.
(d) The inequality 2n &gt; 2n þ 1 is false for n ¼ 1, 2, but it is true for n ¼ 3. If we assume
that 2k &gt; 2k þ 1, then multiplication by 2 gives, when 2k þ 2 &gt; 3, the inequality
2kþ1 &gt; 2ð2k þ 1Þ ¼ 4k þ 2 ¼ 2k þ ð2k þ 2Þ &gt; 2k þ 3 ¼ 2ðk þ 1Þ þ 1:
Since 2k þ 2 &gt; 3 for all k 1, the bridge is valid for all k 1 (even though the statement is
false for k ¼ 1, 2). Hence, with the base n0 ¼ 3, we can apply Mathematical Induction to
conclude that the inequality holds for all n 3.
(e) The inequality 2n # (n þ 1)! can be established by Mathematical Induction.
We first observe that it is true for n ¼ 1, since 21 ¼ 2 ¼ 1 þ 1. If we assume that
k
2 # (k þ 1)!, it follows from the fact that 2 # k þ 2 that
2kþ1 ¼ 2 2k # 2ðk þ 1Þ! # ðk þ 2Þðk þ 1Þ! ¼ ðk þ 2Þ!:
Thus, if the inequality holds for k, then it also holds for k þ 1. Therefore, Mathematical
Induction implies that the inequality is true for all n 2 N.
(f) If r 2 R, r 6¼ 1, and n 2 N, then
1 þ r þ r2 þ

þ rn ¼

1 # rnþ1
:
1#r

This is the formula for the sum of the terms in a ‘‘geometric progression.’’ It can
be established using Mathematical Induction as follows. First, if n ¼ 1, then 1 þ r ¼
(1 # r2)=(1 # r). If we assume the truth of the formula for n ¼ k and add the term rkþ1
to both sides, we get (after a little algebra)
1 þ r þ rk þ

[This result can also be proved without using Mathematical Induction. If we let

ð1 # rÞsn ¼ sn # rsn ¼ 1 # rnþ1 :
If we divide by 1 # r, we obtain the stated formula.]
(g) Careless use of the Principle of Mathematical Induction can lead to obviously absurd
conclusions. The reader is invited to find the error in the ‘‘proof’’ of the following assertion.
Claim:

If n 2 N and if the maximum of the natural numbers p and q is n, then p ¼ q.

‘‘Proof.’’ Let S be the subset of N for which the claim is true. Evidently, 1 2 S since if
p, q 2 N and their maximum is 1, then both equal 1 and so p ¼ q. Now assume that k 2 S and
that the maximum of p and q is k þ 1. Then the maximum of p # 1 and q # 1 is k. But since
k 2 S, then p # 1 ¼ q # 1 and therefore p ¼ q. Thus, k þ 1 2 S, and we conclude that the
assertion is true for all n 2 N.
(h) There are statements that are true for many natural numbers but that are not true for
all of them.
For example, the formula p (n) :¼ n2 # n þ 41 gives a prime number for n ¼ 1, 2, . . . ,
40. However, p(41) is obviously divisible by 41, so it is not a prime number.
Another version of the Principle of Mathematical Induction is sometimes quite useful.
It is called the ‘‘Principle of Strong Induction,’’ even though it is in fact equivalent to 1.2.2.
1.2.5 Principle of Strong Induction Let S be a subset of N such that
(100 ) 1 2 S.
(200 ) For every k 2 N, if f1; 2; . . . ; kg # S, then k þ 1 2 S.
Then S ¼ N.
We will leave it to the reader to establish the equivalence of 1.2.2 and 1.2.5.

Section 1.3 Finite and Infinite Sets
When we count the elements in a set, we say ‘‘one, two, three, . . . ,’’ stopping when we
have exhausted the set. From a mathematical perspective, what we are doing is defining a
bijective mapping between the set and a portion of the set of natural numbers. If the set is
such that the counting does not terminate, such as the set of natural numbers itself, then we
describe the set as being infinite.
The notions of ‘‘finite’’ and ‘‘infinite’’ are extremely primitive, and it is very likely that
the reader has never examined these notions very carefully. In this section we will define
these terms precisely and establish a few basic results and state some other important
results that seem obvious but whose proofs are a bit tricky. These proofs can be found in
Appendix B and can be read later.
1.3.1 Definition (a) The empty set ; is said to have 0 elements.
(b) If n 2 N, a set S is said to have n elements if there exists a bijection from the set
N n :¼ f1; 2; . . . ; ng onto S.
(c) A set S is said to be finite if it is either empty or it has n elements for some n 2 N.
(d) A set S is said to be infinite if it is not finite.
Since the inverse of a bijection is a bijection, it is easy to see that a set S has n
elements if and only if there is a bijection from S onto the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. Also,
since the composition of two bijections is a bijection, we see that a set S1 has n
elements if and only if there is a bijection from S1 onto another set S2 that has n
elements. Further, a set T1 is finite if and only if there is a bijection from T1 onto
another set T2 that is finite.
It is now necessary to establish some basic properties of finite sets to be sure that the
definitions do not lead to conclusions that conflict with our experience of counting. From
the definitions, it is not entirely clear that a finite set might not have n elements for more
than one value of n. Also it is conceivably possible that the set N :¼ f1; 2; 3; . . .g might be
a finite set according to this definition. The reader will be relieved that these possibilities do
not occur, as the next two theorems state. The proofs of these assertions, which use the
fundamental properties of N described in Section 1.2, are given in Appendix B.
1.3.2 Uniqueness Theorem If S is a finite set, then the number of elements in S is a
unique number in N.

1.3 FINITE AND INFINITE SETS

1.3.3 Theorem The set N of natural numbers is an infinite set.
The next result gives some elementary properties of finite and infinite sets.
1.3.4 Theorem (a) If A is a set with m elements and B is a set with n elements and if
A \ B ¼ ; , then A [ B has m þ n elements.
(b) If A is a set with m 2 N elements and C # A is a set with 1 element, then AnC is a set
with m # 1 elements.
(c) If C is an infinite set and B is a finite set, then CnB is an infinite set.
Proof. (a) Let f be a bijection of N m onto A, and let g be a bijection of N n onto B. We
define h on N mþn by h(i) :¼ f (i) for i ¼ 1; . . . ; m and h(i) :¼ g(i # m) for
i ¼ m þ 1; . . . ; m þ n. We leave it as an exercise to show that h is a bijection from
N mþn onto A [ B.
The proofs of parts (b) and (c) are left to the reader, see Exercise 2.
Q.E.D.
It may seem ‘‘obvious’’ that a subset of a finite set is also finite, but the assertion must
be deduced from the definitions. This and the corresponding statement for infinite sets are
established next.
1.3.5 Theorem Suppose that S and T are sets and that T # S.
(a) If S is a finite set, then T is a finite set.
(b) If T is an infinite set, then S is an infinite set.
Proof. (a) If T ¼ ;, we already know that T is a finite set. Thus we may suppose that
T 6¼ ;. The proof is by induction on the number of elements in S.
If S has 1 element, then the only nonempty subset T of S must coincide with S, so T is a
finite set.
Suppose that every nonempty subset of a set with k elements is finite. Now let S be a
set having k þ 1 elements (so there exists a bijection f of N kþ1 onto S), and let T # S. If
f ð k þ 1Þ 2
= T, we can consider T to be a subset of S1 :¼ Snff ð k þ 1Þg, which has k
elements by Theorem 1.3.4(b). Hence, by the induction hypothesis, T is a finite set.
On the other hand, if f ð k þ 1Þ 2 T, then T 1 :¼ Tnff ð k þ 1Þg is a subset of S1. Since
S1 has k elements, the induction hypothesis implies that T1 is a finite set. But this implies
that T ¼ T 1 [ ff ð k þ 1Þg is also a finite set.
(b) This assertion is the contrapositive of the assertion in (a). (See Appendix A for a
discussion of the contrapositive.)
Q.E.D.
Countable Sets
We now introduce an important type of infinite set.
1.3.6 Definition (a) A set S is said to be denumerable (or countably infinite) if there
exists a bijection of N onto S.
(b) A set S is said to be countable if it is either finite or denumerable.
(c) A set S is said to be uncountable if it is not countable.
From the properties of bijections, it is clear that S is denumerable if and only if there
exists a bijection of S onto N. Also a set S1 is denumerable if and only if there exists a

CHAPTER 1 PRELIMINARIES

bijection from S1 onto a set S2 that is denumerable. Further, a set T1 is countable if and only
if there exists a bijection from T1 onto a set T2 that is countable. Finally, an infinite
countable set is denumerable.
1.3.7 Examples (a) The set E :¼ f2n : n 2 N g of even natural numbers is denumerable,
since the mapping f : N ! E defined by f (n) :¼ 2n for n 2 N is a bijection of N onto E.
Similarly, the set O :¼ f2n # 1 : n 2 N g of odd natural numbers is denumerable.
(b) The set Z of all integers is denumerable.
To construct a bijection of N onto Z, we map 1 onto 0, we map the set of even natural
numbers onto the set N of positive integers, and we map the set of odd natural numbers onto
the negative integers. This mapping can be displayed by the enumeration:
Z ¼ f0; 1; # 1; 2; # 2; 3; # 3; . . .g:
(c) The union of two disjoint denumerable sets is denumerable.
Indeed, if A ¼ fa1 ; a2 ; a3 ; . . .g and B ¼ fb1 ; b2 ; b3 ; . . .g, we can enumerate the
elements of A [ B as:
&amp;
a 1 ; b1 ; a2 ; b2 ; a3 ; b3 ; . . . :
1.3.8 Theorem The set N # N is denumerable.
Informal Proof. Recall that N # N consists of all ordered pairs (m, n), where m, n 2 N.
We can enumerate these pairs as:
ð1; 1Þ; ð1; 2Þ; ð2; 1Þ;

ð1; 3Þ; ð2; 2Þ; ð3; 1Þ;

ð1; 4Þ; . . . ;

according to increasing sum m þ n, and increasing m. (See Figure 1.3.1.)

Q.E.D.

The enumeration just described is an instance of a ‘‘diagonal procedure,’’ since we
move along diagonals that each contain finitely many terms as illustrated in Figure 1.3.1.
The bijection indicated by the diagram can be derived as follows. We first notice that
the first diagonal has one point, the second diagonal has two points, and so on, with k points
in the kth diagonal. Applying the formula in Example 1.2.4(a), we see that the total number
of points in diagonals 1 through k is given by
cð k Þ ¼ 1 þ 2 þ

The point (m, n) lies in the kth diagonal when k ¼ m þ n # 1, and it is the mth point in
that diagonal as we move downward from left to right. (For example, the point (3, 2) lies
in the 4th diagonal since 3 þ 2 # 1 ¼ 4, and it is the 3rd point in that diagonal.) Therefore,
in the counting scheme displayed by Figure 1.3.1, we count the point (m, n) by first
counting the points in the first k # 1 ¼ m þ n # 2 diagonals and then adding m. Therefore,
the counting function h : N # N ! N is given by
hðm; nÞ :¼ cðm þ n # 2Þ þ m
¼ 12 ðm þ n # 2Þðm þ n # 1Þ þ m:
For example, the point (3, 2) is counted as number hð3; 2Þ ¼ 12 3 4 þ 3 ¼ 9, as
shown by Figure 1.3.1. Similarly, the point (17, 25) is counted as number h (17, 25) ¼ c(40)
þ 17 ¼ 837.
This geometric argument leading to the counting formula has been suggestive and
convincing, but it remains to be proved that h is, in fact, a bijection of N # N onto N.
A detailed proof is given in Appendix B.
The construction of an explicit bijection between sets is often complicated. The next
two results are useful in establishing the countability of sets, since they do not involve
showing that certain mappings are bijections. The first result may seem intuitively clear,
but its proof is rather technical; it will be given in Appendix B.
1.3.9 Theorem Suppose that S and T are sets and that T # S.
(a) If S is a countable set, then T is a countable set.
(b) If T is an uncountable set, then S is an uncountable set.
1.3.10 Theorem The following statements are equivalent:
(a) S is a countable set.
(b) There exists a surjection of N onto S.
(c) There exists an injection of S into N.
Proof. (a) ) (b)
define H on N by

If S is finite, there exists a bijection h of some set N n onto S and we
HðkÞ :¼

hðkÞ for
hðnÞ for

k ¼ 1; . . . ; n;
k &gt; n:

Then H is a surjection of N onto S.
If S is denumerable, there exists a bijection H of N onto S, which is also a surjection of
N onto S.
(b) ) (c) If H is a surjection of N onto S, we define H 1 : S ! N by letting H1(s) be the
least element in the set H #1 ðsÞ :¼ fn 2 N : HðnÞ ¼ sg. To see that H1 is an injection of S
into N, note that if s, t 2 S and nst :¼ H 1 ðsÞ ¼ H 1 ðtÞ, then s ¼ H(nst) ¼ t.
(c) ) (a) If H1 is an injection of S into N, then it is a bijection of S onto H 1 ðSÞ # N. By
Theorem 1.3.9(a), H1(S) is countable, whence the set S is countable.
Q.E.D.
1.3.11 Theorem The set Q of all rational numbers is denumerable.
Proof. The idea of the proof is to observe that the set Q þ of positive rational numbers is
contained in the enumeration:
1 1 2 1 2 3 1
1; 2; 1; 3; 2; 1; 4;...;

CHAPTER 1 PRELIMINARIES

which is another ‘‘diagonal mapping’’ (see Figure 1.3.2). However, this mapping is not an
injection, since the different fractions 12 and 24 represent the same rational number.

Figure 1.3.2

The set Q þ

To proceed more formally, note that since N # N is countable (by Theorem 1.3.8), it
follows from Theorem 1.3.10(b) that there exists a surjection f of N onto N # N. If g :
N # N ! Q þ is the mapping that sends the ordered pair (m, n) into the rational number
having a representation m=n, then g is a surjection onto Q þ . Therefore, the composition g f
is a surjection of N onto Q þ , and Theorem 1.3.10 implies that Q þ is a countable set.
Similarly, the set Q # of all negative rational numbers is countable. It follows as in
Example 1.3.7(b) that the set Q ¼ Q # [ f0g [ Q þ is countable. Since Q contains N, it
must be a denumerable set.
Q.E.D.
The next result is concerned with unions of sets. In view of Theorem 1.3.10, we need
not be worried about possible overlapping of the sets. Also, we do not have to construct a
bijection.
1.3.12 Theorem If Am is a countable set for each m 2 N, then the union A :¼
is countable.

S1

m¼1

Am

Proof. For each m 2 N, let wm be a surjection of N onto Am. We define b : N # N ! A by
bðm; nÞ :¼ wm ðnÞ:
We claim that b is a surjection. Indeed, if a 2 A, then there exists a least m 2 N such that
a 2 Am, whence there exists a least n 2 N such that a ¼ wm ðnÞ. Therefore, a ¼ b (m, n).
Since N # N is countable, it follows from Theorem 1.3.10 that there exists a surjection
f : N ! N # N whence b f is a surjection of N onto A. Now apply Theorem 1.3.10 again
to conclude that A is countable.
Q.E.D.
Remark A less formal (but more intuitive) way to see the truth of Theorem 1.3.12 is to
enumerate the elements of Am, m 2 N, as:
A1 ¼ fa11 ; a12 ; a13 ; . . .g;
A2 ¼ fa21 ; a22 ; a23 ; . . .g;
A3 ¼ fa31 ; a32 ; a33 ; . . .g;

We then enumerate this array using the ‘‘diagonal procedure’’:

as was displayed in Figure 1.3.1.

Georg Cantor
Georg Cantor (1845–1918) was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. His father,
a Danish businessman working in Russia, moved the family to Germany
several years later. Cantor studied briefly at Zurich, then went to the
University of Berlin, the best in mathematics at the time. He received his
doctorate in 1869, and accepted a position at the University of Halle,
where he worked alone on his research, but would occasionally travel the
seventy miles to Berlin to visit colleagues.
Cantor is known as the founder of modern set theory and he was the first to study the
concept of infinite set in rigorous detail. In 1874 he proved that Q is countable and, in
contrast, that R is uncountable (see Section 2.5), exhibiting two kinds of infinity. In a series of
papers he developed a general theory of infinite sets, including some surprising results. In
1877 he proved that the two-dimensional unit square in the plane could be put into one-one
correspondence with the unit interval on the line, a result he sent in a letter to his colleague
Richard Dedekind in Berlin, writing ‘‘I see it, but I do not believe it.’’ Cantor’s Theorem on
sets of subsets shows there are many different orders of infinity and this led him to create a
theory of ‘‘transfinite’’ numbers that he published in 1895 and 1897. His work generated
considerable controversy among mathematicians of that era, but in 1904, London’s Royal
Society awarded Cantor the Sylvester Medal, its highest honor.
Beginning in 1884, he suffered from episodes of depression that increased in severity as the
years passed. He was hospitalized several times for nervous breakdowns in the Halle Nervenklinik
and spent the last seven months of his life there.

We close this section with one of Cantor’s more remarkable theorems.
1.3.13 Cantor’s Theorem If A is any set, then there is no surjection of A onto the set
PðAÞ of all subsets of A.
Proof. Suppose that w : A ! PðAÞ is a surjection. Since w(a) is a subset of A, either a
belongs to w(a) or it does not belong to this set. We let
D :¼ fa 2 A : a 2
= wðaÞg:
Since D is a subset of A, if w is a surjection, then D ¼ wða0 Þ for some a0 2 A.
We must have either a0 2 D or a0 2
= D. If a0 2 D, then since D ¼ wða0 Þ, we must have
a0 2 wða0 Þ, contrary to the definition of D. Similarly, if a0 2
= D, then a0 2
= wða0 Þ so that
a0 2 D, which is also a contradiction.
Therefore, w cannot be a surjection.
Q.E.D.
Cantor’s Theorem implies that there is an unending progression of larger and larger
sets. In particular, it implies that the collection PðNÞ of all subsets of the natural numbers
N is uncountable.

CHAPTER 2

THE REAL NUMBERS

In this chapter we will discuss the essential properties of the real number system R.
Although it is possible to give a formal construction of this system on the basis of a more
primitive set (such as the set N of natural numbers or the set Q of rational numbers), we
have chosen not to do so. Instead, we exhibit a list of fundamental properties associated
with the real numbers and show how further properties can be deduced from them. This
kind of activity is much more useful in learning the tools of analysis than examining the
logical difficulties of constructing a model for R.
The real number system can be described as a ‘‘complete ordered field,’’ and we will
discuss that description in considerable detail. In Section 2.1, we first introduce the
‘‘algebraic’’ properties—often called the ‘‘field’’ properties in abstract algebra—that are
based on the two operations of addition and multiplication. We continue the section with
the introduction of the ‘‘order’’ properties of R and we derive some consequences of these
properties and illustrate their use in working with inequalities. The notion of absolute
value, which is based on the order properties, is discussed in Section 2.2.
In Section 2.3, we make the final step by adding the crucial ‘‘completeness’’ property
to the algebraic and order properties of R. It is this property, which was not fully
understood until the late nineteenth century, that underlies the theory of limits and
continuity and essentially all that follows in this book. The rigorous development of
real analysis would not be possible without this essential property.
In Section 2.4, we apply the Completeness Property to derive several fundamental
results concerning R, including the Archimedean Property, the existence of square roots,
and the density of rational numbers in R. We establish, in Section 2.5, the Nested Interval
Property and use it to prove the uncountability of R. We also discuss its relation to binary
and decimal representations of real numbers.
Part of the purpose of Sections 2.1 and 2.2 is to provide examples of proofs of
elementary theorems from explicitly stated assumptions. Students can thus gain experience
in writing formal proofs before encountering the more subtle and complicated arguments
related to the Completeness Property and its consequences. However, students who have
previously studied the axiomatic method and the technique of proofs (perhaps in a course
on abstract algebra) can move to Section 2.3 after a cursory look at the earlier sections. A
brief discussion of logic and types of proofs can be found in Appendix A at the back of the
book. Terms such as ‘‘contrapositive’’ and ‘‘converse’’ are explained there and several
proofs are examined in detail.

Section 2.1 The Algebraic and Order Properties of R
We begin with a brief discussion of the ‘‘algebraic structure’’ of the real number system.
We will give a short list of basic properties of addition and multiplication from which all
other algebraic properties can be derived as theorems. In the terminology of abstract

CHAPTER 2 THE REAL NUMBERS

algebra, the system of real numbers is a ‘‘field’’ with respect to addition and multiplication.
The basic properties listed in 2.1.1 are known as the field axioms. A binary operation
associates with each pair (a, b) a unique element B(a, b), but we will use the conventional
notations of a þ b and a # b when discussing the properties of addition and multiplication.
2.1.1 Algebraic Properties of R On the set R of real numbers there are two binary
operations, denoted by þ and # and called addition and multiplication, respectively. These
operations satisfy the following properties:
(A1) a þ b ¼ b þ a for all a, b in R (commutative property of addition);
(A2) ða þ bÞ þ c ¼ a þ ðb þ cÞ for all a, b, c in R (associative property of addition);
(A3) there exists an element 0 in R such that 0 þ a ¼ a and a þ 0 ¼ a for all a in R
(existence of a zero element);
(A4) for each a in R there exists an element #a in R such that a þ ð#aÞ ¼ 0 and ð#aÞ þ
a ¼ 0 (existence of negative elements);
(M1) a # b ¼ b # a for all a, b in R (commutative property of multiplication);
(M2) ða # bÞ # c ¼ a # ðb # cÞ for all a, b, c in R (associative property of multiplication);
(M3) there exists an element 1 in R distinct from 0 such that 1 # a ¼ a and a # 1 ¼ a for all
a in R (existence of a unit element);
(M4) for each a 6¼ 0 in R there exists an element 1=a in R such that a # ð1=aÞ ¼ 1 and
ð1=aÞ # a ¼ 1 (existence of reciprocals);
(D) a # ðb þ cÞ ¼ ða # bÞ þ ða # cÞ and ðb þ cÞ # a ¼ ðb # aÞ þ ðc # aÞ for all a, b, c in R
(distributive property of multiplication over addition).
These properties should be familiar to the reader. The first four are concerned with
addition, the next four with multiplication, and the last one connects the two operations.
The point of the list is that all the familiar techniques of algebra can be derived from these
nine properties, in much the same spirit that the theorems of Euclidean geometry can be
deduced from the five basic axioms stated by Euclid in his Elements. Since this task more
properly belongs to a course in abstract algebra, we will not carry it out here. However, to
exhibit the spirit of the endeavor, we will sample a few results and their proofs.
We first establish the basic fact that the elements 0 and 1, whose existence were
asserted in (A3) and (M3), are in fact unique. We also show that multiplication by 0 always
results in 0.
2.1.2 Theorem (a) If z and a are elements in R with z þ a ¼ a, then z ¼ 0.
(b) If u and b 6¼ 0 are elements in R with u # b ¼ b, then u ¼ 1.
(c) If a 2 R, then a # 0 ¼ 0.
Proof. (a) Using (A3), (A4), (A2), the hypothesis z þ a ¼ a, and (A4), we get
z ¼ z þ 0 ¼ z þ ða þ ð#aÞÞ ¼ ðz þ aÞ þ ð#aÞ ¼ a þ ð#aÞ ¼ 0:
(b) Using (M3), (M4), (M2), the assumed equality u # b ¼ b, and (M4) again, we get
u ¼ u # 1 ¼ u # ðb # ð1=bÞÞ ¼ ðu # bÞ # ð1=bÞ ¼ b # ð1=bÞ ¼ 1:
(c) We have (why?)
a þ a # 0 ¼ a # 1 þ a # 0 ¼ a # ð1 þ 0Þ ¼ a # 1 ¼ a:
Therefore, we conclude from (a) that a # 0 ¼ 0.

We next establish two important properties of multiplication: the uniqueness of reciprocals
and the fact that a product of two numbers is zero only when one of the factors is zero.
2.1.3 Theorem (a) If a 6¼ 0 and b in R are such that a # b ¼ 1, then b ¼ 1=a.
(b) If a # b ¼ 0, then either a ¼ 0 or b ¼ 0.
Proof. (a) Using (M3), (M4), (M2), the hypothesis a # b ¼ 1, and (M3), we have
b ¼ 1 # b ¼ ðð1=aÞ # aÞ # b ¼ ð1=aÞ # ða # bÞ ¼ ð1=aÞ # 1 ¼ 1=a:
(b) It suffices to assume a 6¼ 0 and prove that b ¼ 0. (Why?) We multiply a # b by 1=a and
apply (M2), (M4), and (M3) to get
ð1=aÞ # ða # bÞ ¼ ðð1=aÞ # aÞ # b ¼ 1 # b ¼ b:
Since a # b ¼ 0, by 2.1.2(c) this also equals
ð1=aÞ # ða # bÞ ¼ ð1=aÞ # 0 ¼ 0:
Thus we have b ¼ 0.

Q.E.D.

These theorems represent a small sample of the algebraic properties of the real number
system. Some additional consequences of the field properties are given in the exercises.
The operation of subtraction is defined by a # b :¼ a þ ð#bÞ for a, b in R. Similarly,
division is defined for a, b in R with b 6¼ 0 by a=b :¼ a # ð1=bÞ. In the following, we will
use this customary notation for subtraction and division, and we will use all the familiar
properties of these operations. We will ordinarily drop the use of the dot to indicate
multiplication and write ab for a # b. Similarly, we will use the usual notation for exponents
and write a2 for aa, a3 for ða2 Þa; and, in general, we define anþ1 :¼ ðan Þa for n 2 N. We
agree to adopt the convention that a1 ¼ a. Further, if a 6¼ 0, we write a0 ¼ 1 and a#1 for
1=a, and if n 2 N, we will write a#n for ð1=aÞn, when it is convenient to do so. In general,
we will freely apply all the usual techniques of algebra without further elaboration.
Rational and Irrational Numbers
We regard the set N of natural numbers as a subset of R, by identifying the natural number
n 2 N with the n-fold sum of the unit element 1 2 R. Similarly, we identify 0 2 Z with the
zero element of 0 2 R, and we identify the n-fold sum of #1 with the integer #n. Thus, we
consider N and Z to be subsets of R.
Elements of R that can be written in the form b=a where a; b 2 Z and a 6¼ 0 are called
rational numbers. The set of all rational numbers in R will be denoted by the standard
notation Q . The sum and product of two rational numbers is again a rational number (prove
this), and moreover, the field properties listed at the beginning of this section can be shown
to hold for Q.
The fact that there are elements in R that are not in Q is not immediately apparent. In
the sixth century B.C. the ancient Greek society of Pythagoreans discovered that the
diagonal of a square with unit sides could not be expressed as a ratio of integers. In view of
the Pythagorean Theorem for right triangles, this implies that the square of no rational
number can equal 2. This discovery had a profound impact on the development of Greek
mathematics. One consequence is that elements of R that are not in Q became known as
irrational numbers, meaning that they are not ratios of integers. Although the word
‘‘irrational’’ in modern English usage has a quite different meaning, we shall adopt the
standard mathematical usage of this term.

CHAPTER 2 THE REAL NUMBERS

We will now prove that there does not exist a rational number whose square is 2. In the
proof we use the notions of even and odd numbers. Recall that a natural number is even if it
has the form 2n for some n 2 N, and it is odd if it has the form 2n # 1 for some n 2 N.
Every natural number is either even or odd, and no natural number is both even and odd.
2.1.4 Theorem There does not exist a rational number r such that r2 ¼ 2.
Proof. Suppose, on the contrary, that p and q are integers such that ðp=qÞ2 ¼ 2. We may
assume that p and q are positive and have no common integer factors other than 1. (Why?)
Since p2 ¼ 2q2 , we see that p2 is even. This implies that p is also even (because if p ¼
2n # 1 is odd, then its square p2 ¼ 2ð2n2 # 2n þ 1Þ # 1 is also odd). Therefore, since p and
q do not have 2 as a common factor, then q must be an odd natural number.
Since p is even, then p ¼ 2m for some m 2 N, and hence 4m2 ¼ 2q2 , so that 2m2 ¼ q2 .
Therefore, q2 is even, and it follows that q is an even natural number.
Since the hypothesis that ðp=qÞ2 ¼ 2 leads to the contradictory conclusion that q is
both even and odd, it must be false.
Q.E.D.

The Order Properties of R
The ‘‘order properties’’ of R refer to the notions of positivity and inequalities between real
numbers. As with the algebraic structure of the system of real numbers, we proceed by
isolating three basic properties from which all other order properties and calculations with
inequalities can be deduced. The simplest way to do this is to identify a special subset of R
by using the notion of ‘‘positivity.’’
2.1.5 The Order Properties of R There is a nonempty subset P of R, called the set of
positive real numbers, that satisfies the following properties:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

If a, b belong to P, then a þ b belongs to P.
If a, b belong to P, then ab belongs to P.
If a belongs to R, then exactly one of the following holds:
a 2 P;

a ¼ 0;

# a 2 P:

The first two conditions ensure the compatibility of order with the operations of
addition and multiplication, respectively. Condition 2.1.5(iii) is usually called the
Trichotomy Property, since it divides R into three distinct types of elements. It states
that the set f#a : a 2 Pg of negative real numbers has no elements in common with the set
P of positive real numbers, and, moreover, the set R is the union of three disjoint sets.
If a 2 P, we write a &gt; 0 and say that a is a positive (or a strictly positive) real number.
If a 2 P [ f0g, we write a # 0 and say that a is a nonnegative real number. Similarly, if
#a 2 P, we write a &lt; 0 and say that a is a negative (or a strictly negative) real number.
If #a 2 P [ f0g, we write a # 0 and say that a is a nonpositive real number.
The notion of inequality between two real numbers will now be defined in terms of the
set P of positive elements.
2.1.6 Definition Let a, b be elements of R.
(a) If a # b 2 P, then we write a &gt; b or b &lt; a.
(b) If a # b 2 P [ f0g, then we write a # b or b # a.

2.1 THE ALGEBRAIC AND ORDER PROPERTIES OF R

27

The Trichotomy Property 2.1.5(iii) implies that for a; b 2 R exactly one of the
following will hold:
a &gt; b; a ¼ b; a &lt; b:
Therefore, if both a # b and b # a, then a ¼ b.
For notational convenience, we will write
a&lt;b&lt;c
to mean that both a &lt; b and b &lt; c are satisfied. The other ‘‘double’’ inequalities
a # b &lt; c, a # b # c, and a &lt; b # c are defined in a similar manner.
To illustrate how the basic Order Properties are used to derive the ‘‘rules of inequalities,’’ we
will now establish several results that the reader has used in earlier mathematics courses.
2.1.7 Theorem Let a, b, c be any elements of R.
(a) If a &gt; b and b &gt; c , then a &gt; c.
(b) If a &gt; b, then a þ c &gt; b þ c.
(c) If a &gt; b and c &gt; 0, then ca &gt; cb.
If a &gt; b and c &lt; 0, then ca &lt; cb.
Proof. (a) If a # b 2 P and b # c 2 P, then 2.1.5(i) implies that ða # bÞ þ ðb # cÞ ¼
a # c belongs to P. Hence a &gt; c.
(b) If a # b 2 P, then ða þ cÞ # ðb þ cÞ ¼ a # b is in P. Thus a þ c &gt; b þ c.
(c) If a # b 2 P and c 2 P, then ca # cb ¼ cða # bÞ is in P by 2.1.5(ii). Thus ca &gt; cb
when c &gt; 0.
On the other hand, if c &lt; 0, then #c 2 P, so that cb # ca ¼ ð#cÞða # bÞ is in P. Thus
cb &gt; ca when c &lt; 0.
Q.E.D.
It is natural to expect that the natural numbers are positive real numbers. This property
is derived from the basic properties of order. The key observation is that the square of any
nonzero real number is positive.
2.1.8 Theorem
(a) If a 2 R and a 6¼ 0, then a2 &gt; 0.
(b) 1 &gt; 0.
(c) If n 2 N, then n &gt; 0.
Proof. (a) By the Trichotomy Property, if a 6¼ 0, then either a 2 P or #a 2 P. If a 2 P,
then by 2.1.5(ii), we have a2 ¼ a # a 2 P. Also, if #a 2 P, then a2 ¼ ð#aÞð#aÞ 2 P. We
conclude that if a 6¼ 0, then a2 &gt; 0.
(b) Since 1 ¼ 12 , it follows from (a) that 1 &gt; 0.
(c) We use Mathematical Induction. The assertion for n ¼ 1 is true by (b). If we suppose the
assertion is true for the natural number k, then k 2 P, and since 1 2 P, we have k þ 1 2 P by
2.1.5(i). Therefore, the assertion is true for all natural numbers.
Q.E.D.
It is worth noting that no smallest positive real number can exist. This follows by
observing that if a &gt; 0, then since 12 &gt; 0 (why?), we have that
0 &lt; 12 a &lt; a:


C02

Page 28

CHAPTER 2 THE REAL NUMBERS

Thus if it is claimed that a is the smallest positive real number, we can exhibit a smaller
positive number 12 a.
This observation leads to the next result, which will be used frequently as a method of
proof. For instance, to prove that a number a # 0 is actually equal to zero, we see that it
suffices to show that a is smaller than an arbitrary positive number.
2.1.9 Theorem If a 2 R is such that 0 # a &lt; e for every e &gt; 0, then a ¼ 0.
Proof. Suppose to the contrary that a &gt; 0. Then if we take e0 :¼ 12 a, we have 0 &lt; e0 &lt; a.
Therefore, it is false that a &lt; e for every e &gt; 0 and we conclude that a ¼ 0.
Q.E.D.
Remark It is an exercise to show that if a 2 R is such that 0 # a # e for every e &gt; 0,
then a ¼ 0.
The product of two positive numbers is positive. However, the positivity of a product
of two numbers does not imply that each factor is positive. The correct conclusion is given
in the next theorem. It is an important tool in working with inequalities.
2.1.10 Theorem If ab &gt; 0, then either
(i)
(ii)

a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0, or
a &lt; 0 and b &lt; 0.

Proof. First we note that ab &gt; 0 implies that a ¼
6 0 and b ¼
6 0. (Why?) From the Trichotomy
Property, either a &gt; 0 or a &lt; 0. If a &gt; 0, then 1=a &gt; 0, and therefore b ¼ ð1=aÞ ðabÞ &gt; 0.
Similarly, if a &lt; 0, then 1=a &lt; 0, so that b ¼ ð1=aÞðabÞ &lt; 0.
Q.E.D.
2.1.11 Corollary If ab &lt; 0, then either
(i)
(ii)

a &lt; 0 and b &gt; 0, or
a &gt; 0 and b &lt; 0.

Inequalities
We now show how the Order Properties presented in this section can be used to ‘‘solve’’
certain inequalities. The reader should justify each of the steps.
2.1.12 Examples (a) Determine the set A of all real numbers x such that 2x þ 3 # 6.
We note that we havey
x 2 A () 2x þ 3 # 6 () 2x # 3 () x # 32 :
#
#
Therefore A ¼ x 2 R : x # 32 .
(b) Determine the set B :¼ fx 2 R : x2 þ x &gt; 2g.
We rewrite the inequality so that Theorem 2.1.10 can be applied. Note that
x 2 B () x2 þ x # 2 &gt; 0 () ðx # 1Þðx þ 2Þ &gt; 0:
Therefore, we either have (i) x # 1 &gt; 0 and x þ 2 &gt; 0, or we have (ii) x # 1 &lt; 0 and
x þ 2 &lt; 0. In case (i) we must have both x &gt; 1 and x &gt; #2, which is satisfied if and only
y

The symbol () should be read ‘‘if and only if.’’

if x &gt; 1. In case (ii) we must have both x &lt; 1 and x &lt; #2, which is satisfied if and only
if x &lt; #2.
We conclude that B ¼ fx 2 R : x &gt; 1g [ fx 2 R : x &lt; #2g.
(c) Determine the set
#
#
2x þ 1

C :¼ x 2 R :
xþ2
We note that
x 2 C ()

2x þ 1
x#1
# 1 &lt; 0 ()
&lt; 0:
xþ2
xþ2

Therefore we have either (i) x # 1 &lt; 0 and x þ 2 &gt; 0, or (ii) x # 1 &gt; 0 and x þ 2 &lt; 0.
(Why?) In case (i) we must have both x &lt; 1 and x &gt; #2, which is satisfied if and only if
#2 &lt; x &lt; 1. In case (ii), we must have both x &gt; 1 and x &lt; #2, which is never satisfied.
&amp;
We conclude that C ¼ fx 2 R : #2 &lt; x &lt; 1g.
The following examples illustrate the use of the Order Properties of R in establishing
certain inequalities. The reader should verify the steps in the arguments by identifying the
properties that are employed.
It should be noted that the existence of square roots of positive numbers has not yet
been established; however, we assume the existence of these roots for the purpose of these
examples. (The existence of square roots will be discussed in Section 2.4.)
2.1.13 Examples (a) Let a # 0 and b # 0. Then
ð1Þ

a &lt; b () a2 &lt; b2 ()

pﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃ
a&lt; b

We consider the case where a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0, leaving the case a ¼ 0 to the reader. It follows
from 2.1.5(i) that a þ b &gt; 0. Since b2 # a2 ¼ ðb # aÞðb þ aÞ, it follows from 2.1.7(c) that
b # a &gt; 0 implies that b2 # a2 &gt; 0. Also, it follows from 2.1.10 that b2 # a2 &gt; 0 implies
that b # a &gt; 0.
pﬃﬃﬃ
#pﬃﬃﬃ#2
pﬃﬃﬃ
pﬃﬃﬃ 2
If a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0, then a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0. Since a ¼ ð aÞ and b ¼
bpﬃﬃﬃ, the
second
implication is a consequence of the first one when a and b are replaced by a and
pﬃﬃﬃ
b, respectively.
We also leave it to the reader to show that if a # 0 and b # 0, then

(b) If a and b are positive

geometric mean is ab. The Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality for a, b is
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ð2Þ
ab # 12 ða þ bÞ

with equality occurring if and only if a ¼ b.
pﬃﬃﬃ
pﬃﬃﬃ
To prove this, note that if a &gt; 0; b &gt; 0, and a 6¼ b, then a &gt; 0; b &gt; 0, and
#pﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃ#2
pﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃ
a 6¼ b. (Why?) Therefore it follows from 2.1.8(a) that
a # b &gt; 0. Expanding
this square, we obtain
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
a # 2 ab þ b &gt; 0;
whence it follows that

pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ab &lt; 12 ða þ bÞ:

CHAPTER 2 THE REAL NUMBERS

Therefore (2) holds (with strict inequality) when a 6¼ b. Moreover, if a ¼ bð&gt; 0Þ, then both
sides of (2) equal a, so (2) becomes an equality. This proves that (2) holds for a &gt; 0; b &gt; 0.
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
On the other hand, suppose that a &gt; 0; b &gt; 0 and that ab ¼ 12 ða þ bÞ. Then,
squaring both sides and multiplying by 4, we obtain
4ab ¼ ða þ bÞ2 ¼ a2 þ 2ab þ b2 ;
whence it follows that
0 ¼ a2 # 2ab þ b2 ¼ ða # bÞ2 :
But this equality implies that a ¼ b. (Why?) Thus, equality in (2) implies that a ¼ b.
Remark The general Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality for the positive real
numbers a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an is
ða1 a2 # # # an Þ1=n #

ð3Þ

a1 þ a2 þ # # # þ an
n

with equality occurring if and only if a1 ¼ a2 ¼ # # # ¼ an . It is possible to prove this more
general statement using Mathematical Induction, but the proof is somewhat intricate. A more
elegant proof that uses properties of the exponential function is indicated in Exercise 8.3.9 in
Chapter 8.
(c) Bernoulli’s Inequality. If x &gt; #1, then
ð1 þ xÞn # 1 þ nx

ð4Þ

for all

n2N

The proof uses Mathematical Induction. The case n ¼ 1 yields equality, so the assertion
is valid in this case. Next, we assume the validity of the inequality (4) for k 2 N and will
deduce it for k þ 1. Indeed, the assumptions that ð1 þ xÞk # 1 þ kx and that 1 þ x &gt; 0
imply (why?) that
ð1 þ xÞkþ1 ¼ ð1 þ xÞk # ð1 þ xÞ
# ð1 þ kxÞ # ð1 þ xÞ ¼ 1 þ ðk þ 1Þx þ kx2
# 1 þ ðk þ 1Þx:
Thus, inequality (4) holds for n ¼ k þ 1. Therefore, (4) holds for all n 2 N.

CHAPTER 2 THE REAL NUMBERS

Section 2.2 Absolute Value and the Real Line
From the Trichotomy Property 2.1.5(iii), we are assured that if a 2 R and a 6¼ 0, then
exactly one of the numbers a and #a is positive. The absolute value of a 6¼ 0 is defined to
be the positive one of these two numbers. The absolute value of 0 is defined to be 0.
2.2.1 Definition The absolute value of a real number a, denoted by jaj, is defined by
8
&lt; a if a &gt; 0;
jaj :¼ 0 if a ¼ 0;
:
#a if a &lt; 0:
For example, j5j ¼ 5 and j # 8j ¼ 8. We see from the definition that jaj # 0 for all
a 2 R, and that jaj ¼ 0 if and only if a ¼ 0. Also j # aj ¼ jaj for all a 2 R. Some
additional properties are as follows.
2.2.2 Theorem (a) jabj ¼ jajjbj for all a; b 2 R:
(b) jaj2 ¼ a2 for all a 2 R.
(c) If c # 0, then jaj # c if and only if #c # a # c.
(d) #jaj # a # jaj for all a 2 R.
Proof. (a) If either a or b is 0, then both sides are equal to 0. There are four other cases to
consider. If a &gt; 0; b &gt; 0, then ab &gt; 0, so that jabj ¼ ab ¼ jajjbj. If a &gt; 0; b &lt; 0, then
ab &lt; 0, so that jabj ¼ #ab ¼ að#bÞ ¼ jajjbj. The remaining cases are treated similarly.
(b) Since a2 # 0, we have a2 ¼ ja2 j ¼ jaaj ¼ jajjaj ¼ jaj2 .
(c) If jaj # c, then we have both a # c and #a # c (why?), which is equivalent to #c # a # c.
Conversely, if #c # a # c, then we have both a # c and #a # c (why?), so that jaj # c.
(d) Take c ¼ jaj in part (c).

Q.E.D.

The following important inequality will be used frequently.
2.2.3 Triangle Inequality If a; b 2 R, then ja þ bj # jaj þ jbj.
Proof. From 2.2.2(d), we have #jaj # a # jaj and #jbj # b # jbj. On adding these
inequalities, we obtain
#ðjaj þ jbjÞ # a þ b # jaj þ jbj:
Hence, by 2.2.2(c) we have ja þ bj # jaj þ jbj.

Q.E.D.

It can be shown that equality occurs in the Triangle Inequality if and only if ab &gt; 0,
which is equivalent to saying that a and b have the same sign. (See Exercise 2.)
There are many useful variations of the Triangle Inequality. Here are two.
2.2.4 Corollary If a; b 2 R, then
(a) jaj # jbj # ja # bj;
(b) ja # bj # jaj þ jbj:
Proof. (a) We write a ¼ a # b þ b and then apply the Triangle Inequality to get
jaj ¼ jða # bÞ þ bj # ja # bj þ jbj. Now subtract jbj to get jaj # jbj # ja # bj. Similarly,

2.2 ABSOLUTE VALUE AND THE REAL LINE

from jbj ¼ jb # a þ aj # jb # aj þ jaj, we obtain #ja # bj ¼ #jb # aj # jaj # jbj. If we
combine these two inequalities, using 2.2.2(c), we get the inequality in (a).
(b) Replace b in the Triangle Inequality by #b to get ja # bj # jaj þ j # bj. Since j # bj ¼
jbj we obtain the inequality in (b).
Q.E.D.
A straightforward application of Mathematical Induction extends the Triangle Inequality to any finite number of elements of R.
2.2.5 Corollary If a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an are any real numbers, then
ja1 þ a2 þ # # # þ an j # ja1 j þ ja2 j þ # # # þ jan j:
The following examples illustrate how the properties of absolute value can be used.
2.2.6 Examples (a) Determine the set A of x 2 R such that j2x þ 3j &lt; 7.
From a modification of 2.2.2(c) for the case of strict inequality, we see that x 2 A if
and only if #7 &lt; 2x þ 3 &lt; 7, which is satisfied if and only if #10 &lt; 2x &lt; 4. Dividing by
2, we conclude that A ¼ fx 2 R : #5 &lt; x &lt; 2g.
(b) Determine the set B :¼ fx 2 R : jx # 1j &lt; jxjg.
One method is to consider cases so that the absolute value symbols can be removed.
Here we take the cases
ðiÞ x # 1; ðiiÞ 0 # x &lt; 1; ðiiiÞ x &lt; 0:
(Why did we choose these three cases?) In case (i) the inequality becomes x # 1 &lt; x,
which is satisfied without further restriction. Therefore all x such that x # 1 belong to the
set B. In case (ii), the inequality becomes #ðx # 1Þ &lt; x, which requires that x &gt; 12. Thus,
this case contributes all x such that 12 &lt; x &lt; 1 to the set B. In case (iii), the inequality
becomes #ðx # 1Þ &lt; #x, which is equivalent to 1 &lt; 0. Since this statement is false, no
value of x from case# (iii) satisfies the
# inequality. Forming the union of the three cases, we
conclude that B ¼ x 2 R : x &gt; 12 .
There is a second method of determining the set B based on the fact that a &lt; b if and
only if a2 &lt; b2 when both a # 0 and b # 0. (See 2.1.13(a).) Thus, the inequality jx # 1j &lt;
jxj is equivalent to the inequality jx # 1j2 &lt; jxj2. Since jaj2 ¼ a2 for any a by 2.2.2(b), we
2
2
1
can expand the square
# to obtain x1## 2x þ 1 &lt; x , which simplifies to x &gt; 2. Thus, we
again find that B ¼ x 2 R : x &gt; 2 . This method of squaring can sometimes be used to
advantage, but often a case analysis cannot be avoided when dealing with absolute values.
A graphical view of the inequality is obtained by sketching the graphs of y ¼ jxj and
y ¼ jx # 1j, and interpreting the inequality jx # 1j &lt; jxj to mean that the graph of y ¼
jx # 1j lies underneath the graph of y ¼ jxj. See Figure 2.2.1.

CHAPTER 2 THE REAL NUMBERS

(c) Solve the inequality j2x # 1j # x þ 1.
There are two cases to consider. If x # 12, then j2x # 1j ¼ #2x þ 1 and the inequality
becomes #2x þ 1 # x þ 1, which is x # 0. Thus case one gives us 0 # x # 12. For case two
we assume x # 12, which gives us the inequality 2x # 1 # x þ 1, or x # 2. Since x # 12, we
obtain 12 # x # 2. Combining the two cases, we get 0 # x # 2. See Figure 2.2.2.

(d) Let the function f be defined by f ðxÞ :¼ ð2x2 þ 3x þ 1Þ=ð2x # 1Þ for 2 # x &lt; 3.

We consider separately the numerator and denominator of
j f ðxÞj ¼

j2x2 þ 3x þ 1j

j2x # 1j

From the Triangle Inequality, we obtain
j2x2 þ 3x þ 1j # 2jxj2 þ 3jxj þ 1 # 2 # 32 þ 3 # 3 þ 1 ¼ 28
since jxj # 3 for the x under consideration. Also, j2x # 1j # 2jxj # 1 # 2 # 2 # 1 ¼ 3
since jxj # 2 for the x under consideration. Thus, 1=j2x # 1j # 1=3 for x # 2. (Why?)
Therefore, for 2 # x # 3 we have j f ðxÞj # 28=3. Hence we can take M ¼ 28=3. (Note
that we have found one such constant M; evidently any number H &gt; 28=3 will also
satisfy j f ðxÞj # H. It is also possible that 28=3 is not the smallest possible choice
&amp;
for M.)

The Real Line
A convenient and familiar geometric interpretation of the real number system is the real
line. In this interpretation, the absolute value jaj of an element a in R is regarded as the
distance from a to the origin 0. More generally, the distance between elements a and b in R
is ja # bj. (See Figure 2.2.3.)

Later we will need precise language to discuss the notion of one real number being
‘‘close to’’ another. If a is a given real number, then saying that a real number x is ‘‘close
to’’ a should mean that the distance jx # aj between them is ‘‘small.’’ A context in which
this idea can be discussed is provided by the terminology of neighborhoods, which we
now define.
2.2.7 Definition Let a 2 R and e &gt; 0. Then the e-neighborhood of a is the set
V e ðaÞ :¼ fx 2 R : jx # aj &lt; eg.
For a 2 R, the statement that x belongs to V e ðaÞ is equivalent to either of the
statements (see Figure 2.2.4)
#e &lt; x # a &lt; e () a # e &lt; x &lt; a þ e:

Figure 2.2.4

An e-neighborhood of a

2.2.8 Theorem Let a 2 R. If x belongs to the neighborhood V e ðaÞ for every e &gt; 0, then
x ¼ a.
Proof. If a particular x satisfies jx # aj &lt; e for every e &gt; 0, then it follows from 2.1.9 that
jx # aj ¼ 0, and hence x ¼ a.
Q.E.D.
2.2.9 Examples (a) Let U :¼ fx : 0 &lt; x &lt; 1g. If a 2 U, then let e be the smaller of the
two numbers a and 1 # a. Then it is an exercise to show that V e ðaÞ is contained in U. Thus
each element of U has some e-neighborhood of it contained in U.
(b) If I :¼ fx : 0 # x # 1g, then for any e &gt; 0, the e-neighborhood V e ð0Þ of 0 contains
points not in I, and so V e ð0Þ is not contained in I. For example, the number xe :¼ #e=2 is in
V e ð0Þ but not in I.
(c) If jx # aj &lt; e and jy # bj &lt; e, then the Triangle Inequality implies that
jðx þ yÞ # ða þ bÞj ¼ jðx # aÞ þ ðy # bÞj
# jx # aj þ jy # bj &lt; 2e:
Thus if x, y belong to the e-neighborhoods of a, b, respectively, then x þ y belongs to the
&amp;
2e-neighborhood of a þ b (but not necessarily to the e-neighborhood of a þ b).

Section 2.3 The Completeness Property of R
Thus far, we have discussed the algebraic properties and the order properties of the real number
system R. In this section we shall present one more property of R that is often called the
‘‘Completeness Property.’’ The system Q of rational numbers also has
pﬃﬃthe
ﬃ algebraic and order
properties described in the preceding
sections,
but
we
have
seen
that
2
cannot be represented
pﬃﬃﬃ
as a rational number; therefore 2 does not belong to Q . This observation shows the necessity
of an additional property to characterize the real number system. This additional property, the
Completeness (or the Supremum) Property, is an essential property of R, and we will say that R
is a complete ordered field. It is this special property that permits us to define and develop the
various limiting procedures that will be discussed in the chapters that follow.
There are several different ways to describe the Completeness Property. We choose to
give what is probably the most efficient approach by assuming that each nonempty
bounded subset of R has a supremum.

2.3 THE COMPLETENESS PROPERTY OF R

37

Suprema and Infima
We now introduce the notions of upper bound and lower bound for a set of real numbers.
These ideas will be of utmost importance in later sections.
2.3.1 Definition Let S be a nonempty subset of R.
(a) The set S is said to be bounded above if there exists a number u 2 R such that s # u
for all s 2 S. Each such number u is called an upper bound of S.
(b) The set S is said to be bounded below if there exists a number w 2 R such that w # s
for all s 2 S. Each such number w is called a lower bound of S.
(c) A set is said to be bounded if it is both bounded above and bounded below. A set is
said to be unbounded if it is not bounded.
For example, the set S :¼ fx 2 R : x &lt; 2g is bounded above; the number 2 and any
number larger than 2 is an upper bound of S. This set has no lower bounds, so that the set is
not bounded below. Thus it is unbounded (even though it is bounded above).
If a set has one upper bound, then it has infinitely many upper bounds, because if u is an
upper bound of S, then the numbers u þ 1; u þ 2; . . . are also upper bounds of S. (A similar
observation is valid for lower bounds.)
In the set of upper bounds of S and the set of lower bounds of S, we single out their least
and greatest elements, respectively, for special attention in the following definition. (See
Figure 2.3.1.)

Figure 2.3.1

inf S and sup S

2.3.2 Definition Let S be a nonempty subset of R.
(a) If S is bounded above, then a number u is said to be a supremum (or a least upper
bound) of S if it satisfies the conditions:
(1) u is an upper bound of S, and
(2) if v is any upper bound of S, then u # v.
(b) If S is bounded below, then a number w is said to be an infimum (or a greatest lower
bound) of S if it satisfies the conditions:
(10 ) w is a lower bound of S, and
(20 ) if t is any lower bound of S, then t # w.
It is not difficult to see that there can be only one supremum of a given subset S of R.
(Then we can refer to the supremum of a set instead of a supremum.) For, suppose that u1
and u2 are both suprema of S. If u1 &lt; u2 , then the hypothesis that u2 is a supremum implies
that u1 cannot be an upper bound of S. Similarly, we see that u2 &lt; u1 is not possible.
Therefore, we must have u1 ¼ u2 . A similar argument can be given to show that the
infimum of a set is uniquely determined.
If the supremum or the infimum of a set S exists, we will denote them by
sup S

and

inf S:

38

Page 38

CHAPTER 2 THE REAL NUMBERS

We also observe that if u0 is an arbitrary upper bound of a nonempty set S, then sup S # u0 .
This is because sup S is the least of the upper bounds of S.
First of all, it needs to be emphasized that in order for a nonempty set S in R to have a
supremum, it must have an upper bound. Thus, not every subset of R has a supremum;
similarly, not every subset of R has an infimum. Indeed, there are four possibilities for a
nonempty subset S of R: it can
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

have
have
have
have

both a supremum and an infimum,
a supremum but no infimum,
an infimum but no supremum,
neither a supremum nor an infimum.

We also wish to stress that in order to show that u ¼ sup S for some nonempty subset S
of R, we need to show that both (1) and (2) of Definition 2.3.2(a) hold. It will be instructive
to reformulate these statements.
The definition of u ¼ sup S asserts that u is an upper bound of S such that u # v for any
upper bound v of S. It is useful to have alternative ways of expressing the idea that u is the
‘‘least’’ of the upper bounds of S. One way is to observe that any number smaller than u is
not an upper bound of S. That is, if z &lt; u, then z is not an upper bound of S. But to say that z
is not an upper bound of S means there exists an element sz in S such that z &lt; sz . Similarly,
if e &gt; 0, then u # e is smaller than u and thus fails to be an upper bound of S.
The following statements about an upper bound u of a set S are equivalent:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

if
if
if
if

v is any upper bound of S, then u # v,
z &lt; u, then z is not an upper bound of S,
z &lt; u, then there exists sz 2 S such that z &lt; sz ,
e &gt; 0, then there exists se 2 S such that u # e &lt; se .

Therefore, we can state two alternate formulations for the supremum.
2.3.3 Lemma A number u is the supremum of a nonempty subset S of R if and only if u
satisfies the conditions:
(1) s # u for all s 2 S,
(2) if v &lt; u, then there exists s0 2 S such that v &lt; s0 .
For future work with limits, it is useful to have this condition expressed in terms of
e &gt; 0. This is done in the next lemma.
2.3.4 Lemma An upper bound u of a nonempty set S in R is the supremum of S if and
only if for every e &gt; 0 there exists an se 2 S such that u # e &lt; se .
Proof. If u is an upper bound of S that satisfies the stated condition and if v &lt; u, then we
put e :¼ u # v. Then e &gt; 0, so there exists se 2 S such that v ¼ u # e &lt; se . Therefore, v is
not an upper bound of S, and we conclude that u ¼ sup S.
Conversely, suppose that u ¼ sup S and let e &gt; 0. Since u # e &lt; u, then u # e is not an
upper bound of S. Therefore, some element se of S must be greater than u # e; that is,
u # e &lt; se . (See Figure 2.3.2.)
Q.E.D.
It is important to realize that the supremum of a set may or may not be an element of
the set. Sometimes it is and sometimes it is not, depending on the particular set. We
consider a few examples.

u ¼ sup S

2.3.5 Examples (a) If a nonempty set S1 has a finite number of elements, then it can be
shown that S1 has a largest element u and a least element w. Then u ¼ sup S1 and w ¼ inf S1,
and they are both members of S1. (This is clear if S1 has only one element, and it can be
proved by induction on the number of elements in S1; see Exercises 12 and 13.)
(b) The set S2 :¼ fx : 0 # x # 1g clearly has 1 for an upper bound. We prove that 1 is its
supremum as follows. If v &lt; 1, there exists an element s0 2 S2 such that v &lt; s0 . (Name one
such element s0 .) Therefore v is not an upper bound of S2 and, since v is an arbitrary number
v &lt; 1, we conclude that sup S2 ¼ 1. It is similarly shown that inf S2 ¼ 0. Note that both the
supremum and the infimum of S2 are contained in S2.
(c) The set S3 :¼ fx : 0 &lt; x &lt; 1g clearly has 1 for an upper bound. Using the same
argument as given in (b), we see that sup S3 ¼ 1. In this case, the set S3 does not contain its
supremum. Similarly, inf S3 ¼ 0 is not contained in S3.
&amp;

The Completeness Property of R
It is not possible to prove on the basis of the field and order properties of R that were
discussed in Section 2.1 that every nonempty subset of R that is bounded above has a
supremum in R. However, it is a deep and fundamental property of the real number system
that this is indeed the case. We will make frequent and essential use of this property,
especially in our discussion of limiting processes. The following statement concerning the
existence of suprema is our final assumption about R. Thus, we say that R is a complete
ordered field.
2.3.6 The Completeness Property of R Every nonempty set of real numbers that has
an upper bound also has a supremum in R.
This property is also called the Supremum Property of R. The analogous property for
infima can be deduced from the Completeness Property as follows. Suppose that S is a
nonempty subset of R that is bounded below. Then the nonempty set S :¼ f#s : s 2 Sg is
bounded above, and the Supremum Property implies that u :¼ sup S exists in R. The reader
should verify in detail that –u is the infimum of S.

Section 2.4 Applications of the Supremum Property
We will now discuss how to work with suprema and infima. We will also give some very
important applications of these concepts to derive fundamental properties of R. We begin
with examples that illustrate useful techniques in applying the ideas of supremum and
infimum.
2.4.1 Examples (a) It is an important fact that taking suprema and infima of sets is
compatible with the algebraic properties of R. As an example, we present here the
compatibility of taking suprema and addition.
Let S be a nonempty subset of R that is bounded above, and let a be any number in R.
Define the set a þ S :¼ fa þ s : s 2 Sg. We will prove that
supða þ SÞ ¼ a þ sup S:
If we let u :¼ sup S, then x # u for all x 2 S, so that a þ x # a þ u. Therefore, a þ u
is an upper bound for the set a þ S ; consequently, we have supða þ SÞ # a þ u.
Now if v is any upper bound of the set a þ S, then a þ x # v for all x 2 S.
Consequently x # v # a for all x 2 S, so that v # a is an upper bound of S. Therefore,
u ¼ sup S # v # a, which gives us a þ u # v. Since v is any upper bound of a þ S, we can
replace v by supða þ SÞ to get a þ u # supða þ SÞ.
Combining these inequalities, we conclude that
supða þ SÞ ¼ a þ u ¼ a þ sup S:
For similar relationships between the suprema and infima of sets and the operations of
addition and multiplication, see the exercises.

(b) If the suprema or infima of two sets are involved, it is often necessary to establish
results in two stages, working with one set at a time. Here is an example.
Suppose that A and B are nonempty subsets of R that satisfy the property:
a#b

for all a 2 A and all b 2 B:

We will prove that
sup A # inf B:
For, given b 2 B, we have a # b for all a 2 A. This means that b is an upper bound of A, so
that sup A # b. Next, since the last inequality holds for all b 2 B, we see that the number
&amp;
sup A is a lower bound for the set B. Therefore, we conclude that sup A # inf B.

Functions
The idea of upper bound and lower bound is applied to functions by considering the range
of a function. Given a function f : D ! R, we say that f is bounded above if the set
f ðDÞ ¼ f f ðxÞ : x 2 Dg is bounded above in R; that is, there exists B 2 R such that f ðxÞ #
B for all x 2 D. Similarly, the function f is bounded below if the set f (D) is bounded below.
We say that f is bounded if it is bounded above and below; this is equivalent to saying that
there exists B 2 R such that j f ðxÞj # B for all x 2 D.
The following example illustrates how to work with suprema and infima of functions.
2.4.2 Examples Suppose that f and g are real-valued functions with common domain
D # R. We assume that f and g are bounded.
(a) If f ðxÞ # gðxÞ for all x 2 D, then sup f ðDÞ # sup gðDÞ, which is sometimes written:
sup f ðxÞ # sup gðxÞ:
x2D

x2D

We first note that f ðxÞ # gðxÞ # sup gðDÞ, which implies that the number sup g(D) is
an upper bound for f (D). Therefore, sup f ðDÞ # sup gðDÞ.
(b) We note that the hypothesis f ðxÞ # gðxÞ for all x 2 D in part (a) does not imply any
relation between sup f(D) and inf g(D).
For example, if f ðxÞ :¼ x2 and gðxÞ :¼ x with D ¼ fx : 0 # x # 1g, then f ðxÞ # gðxÞ
for all x 2 D. However, we see that sup f ðDÞ ¼ 1 and inf gðDÞ ¼ 0. Since sup gðDÞ ¼ 1, the
conclusion of (a) holds.
(c) If f ðxÞ # gðyÞ for all x, y 2 D, then we may conclude that sup f ðDÞ # infgðDÞ, which
we may write as:
sup f ðxÞ # inf gðyÞ:
x2D

y2D

(Note that the functions in (b) do not satisfy this hypothesis.)
The proof proceeds in two stages as in Example 2.4.l(b). The reader should write out
&amp;
the details of the argument.
Further relationships between suprema and infima of functions are given in the exercises.

The Archimedean Property
Because of your familiarity with the set R and the customary picture of the real line, it may
seem obvious that the set N of natural numbers is not bounded in R. How can we prove this

‘‘obvious’’ fact? In fact, we cannot do so by using only the Algebraic and Order Properties
given in Section 2.1. Indeed, we must use the Completeness Property of R as well as the
Inductive Property of N (that is, if n 2 N, then n þ 1 2 N).
The absence of upper bounds for N means that given any real number x there exists a
natural number n (depending on x) such that x &lt; n.
2.4.3 Archimedean Property If x 2 R, then there exists nx 2 N such that x # nx .
Proof. If the assertion is false, then n # x for all n 2 N; therefore, x is an upper bound
of N. Therefore, by the Completeness Property, the nonempty set N has a supremum u 2 R.
Subtracting 1 from u gives a number u # 1, which is smaller than the supremum u of N.
Therefore u # 1 is not an upper bound of N, so there exists m 2 N with u # 1 &lt; m. Adding
1 gives u &lt; m þ 1, and since m þ 1 2 N, this inequality contradicts the fact that u is an
upper bound of N.
Q.E.D.
2.4.4 Corollary If S :¼ f1=n : n 2 Ng, then inf S ¼ 0.
Proof. Since S 6¼ ; is bounded below by 0, it has an infimum and we let w :¼ inf S. It is
clear that w # 0. For any e &gt; 0, the Archimedean Property implies that there exists n 2 N
such that 1=e &lt; n, which implies 1=n &lt; e. Therefore we have
0 # w # 1=n &lt; e:
But since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, it follows from Theorem 2.1.9 that w ¼ 0.

Q.E.D.

2.4.5 Corollary If t &gt; 0, there exists nt 2 N such that 0 &lt; 1=nt &lt; t.
Proof. Since inf f1=n : n 2 N g ¼ 0 and t &gt; 0, then t is not a lower bound for the set
f1=n : n 2 Ng. Thus there exists nt 2 N such that 0 &lt; 1=nt &lt; t.
Q.E.D.
2.4.6 Corollary If y &gt; 0, there exists ny 2 N such that ny # 1 # y # ny .
Proof. The Archimedean Property ensures that the subset Ey :¼ fm 2 N : y &lt; mg of
N is not empty. By the Well-Ordering Property 1.2.1, Ey has a least element, which
we denote by ny. Then ny # 1 does not belong to Ey, and hence we have
ny # 1 # y &lt; ny .

Collectively, the Corollaries 2.4.4–2.4.6 are sometimes referred to as the Archimedean
Property of R.
The Existence of

2

The importance of the Supremum Property lies in the fact that it guarantees the existence of
real numbers under certain hypotheses. We shall make use of it in this way many times. At
the moment, we shall illustrate this use by proving the existence of a positive real number x
such that x2 ¼ 2; that is, the positive square root of 2. It was shown earlier (see Theorem
2.1.4) that such an x cannot be a rational number; thus, we will be deriving the existence of
at least one irrational number.

2.4.7 Theorem There exists a positive real number x such that x2 ¼ 2.
#
#
Proof. Let S :¼ s 2 R : 0 # s; s2 &lt; 2 . Since 1 2 S, the set is not empty. Also, S is
bounded above by 2, because if t &gt; 2, then t2 &gt; 4 so that t 2
= S. Therefore the Supremum
Property implies that the set S has a supremum in R, and we let x :¼ sup S. Note that x &gt; 1.
We will prove that x2 ¼ 2 by ruling out the other two possibilities: x2 &lt; 2 and x2 &gt; 2.
First assume that x2 &lt; 2. We will show that this assumption contradicts the fact that
x ¼ sup S by finding an n 2 N such that x þ 1=n 2 S, thus implying that x is not an upper
bound for S. To see how to choose n, note that 1=n2 # 1=n so that
xþ

1
n

¼ x2 þ

2x 1
1
þ # x2 þ ð2x þ 1Þ:
n n2
n

Hence if we can choose n so that
1
ð2x þ 1Þ &lt; 2 # x2 ;
n
then we get ðx þ 1=nÞ2 &lt; x2 þ ð2 # x2 Þ ¼ 2. By assumption we have 2 # x2 &gt; 0, so that
ð2 # x2 Þ=ð2x þ 1Þ &gt; 0. Hence the Archimedean Property (Corollary 2.4.5) can be used to
obtain n 2 N such that
1 2 # x2
&lt;
:
n 2x þ 1
These steps can be reversed to show that for this choice of n we have x þ 1=n 2 S, which
contradicts the fact that x is an upper bound of S. Therefore we cannot have x2 &lt; 2.
Now assume that x2 &gt; 2. We will show that it is then possible to find m 2 N such that
x # 1=m is also an upper bound of S, contradicting the fact that x ¼ sup S. To do this, note
that
x#

m

¼ x2 #

2x

2x
þ 2 &gt; x2 # :
m m
m

Hence if we can choose m so that
2x
&lt; x2 # 2;
m
then ðx # 1=mÞ2 &gt; x2 # ðx2 # 2Þ ¼ 2. Now by assumption we have x2 # 2 &gt; 0, so that
ðx2 # 2Þ=2x &gt; 0. Hence, by the Archimedean Property, there exists m 2 N such that
1 x2 # 2
&lt;
:
m
2x
These steps can be reversed to show that for this choice of m we have ðx # 1=mÞ2 &gt; 2.
Now if s 2 S, then s2 &lt; 2 &lt; ðx # 1=mÞ2 , whence it follows from 2.1.13(a) that
s &lt; x # 1=m. This implies that x#1/m is an upper bound for S, which contradicts the
fact that x ¼ sup S. Therefore we cannot have x2 &gt; 2.
Since the possibilities x2 &lt; 2 and x2 &gt; 2 have been excluded, we must have
2
x ¼ 2.
Q.E.D.
By slightly modifying the preceding argument, the reader can show that if a &gt; 0, then
there is a unique
such that b2 ¼ a. We call b the positive square root of a and denote
pﬃﬃﬃ b &gt; 01=2
it by b ¼ a or b ¼ a . A slightly more complicated argument involving the binomial

theorem canpbe
ﬃﬃﬃ formulated to establish the existence of a unique positive nth root of a,
denoted by n a or a1=n, for each n 2 N.
Remark If in the proof of Theorem 2.4.7 we replace the set S by the set of rational
numbers T :¼ fr 2 Q : 0 # r; r2 &lt; 2g, the argument then gives the conclusion that y :¼
sup T satisfies y2 ¼ 2. Since we have seen in Theorem 2.1.4 that y cannot be a rational
number, it follows that the set T that consists of rational numbers does not have a supremum
belonging to the set Q . Thus the ordered field Q of rational numbers does not possess the
Completeness Property.
Density of Rational Numbers in R

pﬃﬃﬃ
We now know that there exists at least one irrational real number, namely 2. Actually there
are ‘‘more’’ irrational numbers than rational numbers in the sense that the set of rational
numbers is countable (as shown in Section 1.3), while the set of irrational numbers is
uncountable (see Section 2.5). However, we next show that in spite of this apparent disparity,
the set of rational numbers is ‘‘dense’’ in R in the sense that given any two real numbers there
is a rational number between them (in fact, there are infinitely many such rational numbers).
2.4.8 The Density Theorem If x and y are any real numbers with x &lt; y, then there
exists a rational number r 2 Q such that x &lt; r &lt; y.
Proof. It is no loss of generality (why?) to assume that x &gt; 0. Since y # x &gt; 0, it follows
from Corollary 2.4.5 that there exists n 2 N such that 1=n &lt; y # x. Therefore, we have
nx þ 1 &lt; ny. If we apply Corollary 2.4.6 to nx &gt; 0, we obtain m 2 N with
m # 1 # nx &lt; m. Therefore, m # nx þ 1 &lt; ny, whence nx &lt; m &lt; ny. Thus, the rational
number r :¼ m=n satisfies x &lt; r &lt; y.
Q.E.D.
To round out the discussion of the interlacing of rational and irrational numbers, we
have the same ‘‘betweenness property’’ for the set of irrational numbers.
2.4.9 Corollary If x and y are real numbers with x &lt; y, then there exists an irrational
number z such that x &lt; z &lt; y.
pﬃﬃﬃ

Proof. If we apply the Density Theorem 2.4.8 to the real numbers x= 2 and y= 2, we
obtain a rational number r 6¼ 0 (why?) such that

Section 2.5 Intervals
The Order Relation on R determines a natural collection of subsets called ‘‘intervals.’’
The notations and terminology for these special sets will be familiar from earlier
courses. If a; b 2 R satisfy a &lt; b, then the open interval determined by a and b is
the set
ða; bÞ :¼ fx 2 R : a &lt; x &lt; bg:
The points a and b are called the endpoints of the interval; however, the endpoints are not
included in an open interval. If both endpoints are adjoined to this open interval, then we
obtain the closed interval determined by a and b; namely, the set
½a; b :¼ fx 2 R : a # x # bg:
The two half-open (or half-closed) intervals determined by a and b are [a, b), which
includes the endpoint a, and (a, b], which includes the endpoint b.
Each of these four intervals is bounded and has length defined by b # a. If a ¼ b, the
corresponding open interval is the empty set ða; aÞ ¼ ;, whereas the corresponding closed
interval is the singleton set ½a; a ¼ fag.
There are five types of unbounded intervals for which the symbols 1ðor þ 1Þ and #1
are used as notational convenience in place of the endpoints. The infinite open intervals are
the sets of the form
ða; 1Þ :¼ fx 2 R : x &gt; ag and ð#1; bÞ :¼ fx 2 R : x &lt; bg:


C02

12/09/2010

15:11:37

Page 47

2.5 INTERVALS

47

The first set has no upper bounds and the second one has no lower bounds. Adjoining
endpoints gives us the infinite closed intervals:
½a; 1Þ :¼ fx 2 R : a # xg

ð#1; b :¼ fx 2 R : x # bg:

and

It is often convenient to think of the entire set R as an infinite interval; in this case, we write
ð#1; 1Þ :¼ R. No point is an endpoint of ð#1; 1Þ.
Warning It must be emphasized that 1 and #1 are not elements of R, but only
convenient symbols.
Characterization of Intervals
An obvious property of intervals is that if two points x, y with x &lt; y belong to an interval I,
then any point lying between them also belongs to I. That is, if x &lt; t &lt; y, then the point t
belongs to the same interval as x and y. In other words, if x and y belong to an interval I,
then the interval [x, y] is contained in I. We now show that a subset of R possessing this
property must be an interval.
2.5.1 Characterization Theorem If S is a subset of R that contains at least two points
and has the property
ð1Þ

if

x; y 2 S

and

x &lt; y;

then

½x; y # S;

then S is an interval.
Proof. There are four cases to consider: (i) S is bounded, (ii) S is bounded above but not
below, (iii) S is bounded below but not above, and (iv) S is neither bounded above nor
below.
Case (i): Let a :¼ inf S and b :¼ sup S. Then S # ½a; b and we will show that
ða; bÞ # S.
If a &lt; z &lt; b, then z is not a lower bound of S, so there exists x 2 S with x &lt; z. Also, z
is not an upper bound of S, so there exists y 2 S with z &lt; y. Therefore z 2 ½x; y , so property
(1) implies that z 2 S. Since z is an arbitrary element of ða; bÞ, we conclude that ða; bÞ # S.
Now if a 2 S and b 2 S, then S ¼ ½a; b . (Why?) If a 2
= S and b 2
= S, then S ¼ ða; bÞ.
The other possibilities lead to either S ¼ ða; b or S ¼ ½a; bÞ.
Case (ii): Let b :¼ sup S. Then S # ð#1; b and we will show that ð#1; bÞ # S. For,
if z &lt; b, then there exist x; y 2 S such that z 2 ½x; y # S. (Why?) Therefore ð#1; bÞ # S.
If b 2 S, then S ¼ ð#1; b , and if b 2
= S, then S ¼ ð#1; bÞ.
Cases (iii) and (iv) are left as exercises.
Q.E.D.
Nested Intervals
We say that a sequence of intervals I n ; n 2 N, is nested if the following chain of inclusions
holds (see Figure 2.5.1):
I1

I2

###

In

I nþ1

###

For example, if I n :¼ ½0; 1=n for n 2 N, then I n I nþ1 for each n 2 N so that this
sequence of intervals is nested. In this case, the element 0 belongs to all I n and the
Archimedean Property 2.4.3 can be usedTto show that 0 is the only such common point.
(Prove this.) We denote this by writing 1
n¼1 I n ¼ f0g.
It is important to realize that, in general, a nested sequence of intervals need not have a
common point. For example, if J n :¼ ð0; 1=nÞ for n 2 N, then this sequence of intervals is

Nested intervals

nested, but there is no common point, since for every given x &gt; 0, there exists (why?)
m 2 N such that 1=m &lt; x so that x 2
= J m . Similarly, the sequence of intervals
K n :¼ ðn; 1Þ; n 2 N, is nested but has no common point. (Why?)
However, it is an important property of R that every nested sequence of closed,
bounded intervals does have a common point, as we will now prove. Notice that the
completeness of R plays an essential role in establishing this property.
2.5.2 Nested Intervals Property If I n ¼ ½an ; bn ; n 2 N, is a nested sequence of closed
bounded intervals, then there exists a number j 2 R such that j 2 I n for all n 2 N.
Proof. Since the intervals are nested, we have I n # I 1 for all n 2 N, so that an # b1 for all
n 2 N. Hence, the nonempty set fan : n 2 Ng is bounded above, and we let j be its
supremum. Clearly an # j for all n 2 N.
We claim also that j # bn for all n. This is established by showing that for any
particular n, the number bn is an upper bound for the set fak : k 2 Ng. We consider two
cases. (i) If n # k, then since I n I k , we have ak # bk # bn . (ii) If k &lt; n, then since
I k I n , we have ak # an # bn . (See Figure 2.5.2.) Thus, we conclude that ak # bn for all
k, so that bn is an upper bound of the set fak : k 2 Ng. Hence, j # bn for each n 2 N. Since
an # j # bn for all n, we have j 2 I n for all n 2 N.
Q.E.D.

2.5.3 Theorem If I n :¼ ½an ; bn ; n 2 N, is a nested sequence of closed, bounded intervals
such that the lengths bn # an of I n satisfy
inf fbn # an : n 2 N g ¼ 0;
then the number j contained in In for all n 2 N is unique.
Proof. If h :¼ inf fbn : n 2 N g, then an argument similar to the proof of 2.5.2 can be used
to show that an # h for all n, and hence that j # h. In fact, it is an exercise (see Exercise 10) to
show that x 2 I n for all n 2 N if and only if j # x # h. If we have inf fbn # an : n 2 N g ¼ 0,

then for any e &gt; 0, there exists an m 2 N such that 0 # h # j # bm # am &lt; e. Since this
holds for all e &gt; 0, it follows from Theorem 2.1.9 that h # j ¼ 0. Therefore, we conclude
that j ¼ h is the only point that belongs to In for every n 2 N.
Q.E.D.
The Uncountability of R
The concept of a countable set was discussed in Section 1.3 and the countability of the set
Q of rational numbers was established there. We will now use the Nested Interval Property
to prove that the set R is an uncountable set. The proof was given by Georg Cantor in 1874
in the first of his papers on infinite sets. He later published a proof that used decimal
representations of real numbers, and that proof will be given later in this section.
2.5.4 Theorem The set R of real numbers is not countable.
Proof. We will prove that the unit interval I :¼ ½0; 1 is an uncountable set. This implies
that the set R is an uncountable set, for if R were countable, then the subset I would also be
countable. (See Theorem 1.3.9(a).)
The proof is by contradiction. If we assume that I is countable, then we can enumerate
the set as I ¼ fx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn ; . . .g. We first select a closed subinterval I 1 of I such that
x1 2
= I 1 , then select a closed subinterval I2 of I1 such that x2 2
= I 2 , and so on. In this way, we
obtain nonempty closed intervals
I1

such that I n # I and xn 2
= I n for all n. The Nested Intervals Property 2.5.2 implies that there
exists a point j 2 I such that j 2 I n for all n. Therefore j 6¼ xn for all n 2 N, so the
enumeration of I is not a complete listing of the elements of I, as claimed. Hence, I is an
uncountable set.
Q.E.D.
The fact that the set R of real numbers is uncountable can be combined with the fact that
the set Q of rational numbers is countable to conclude that the set RnQ of irrational numbers
is uncountable. Indeed, since the union of two countable sets is countable (see 1.3.7(c)), if
RnQ is countable, then since R ¼ Q [ ðRnQ Þ, we conclude that R is also a countable set,
which is a contradiction. Therefore, the set of irrational numbers RnQ is an uncountable set.
Note: The set of real numbers can also be divided into two subsets of numbers called
algebraic numbers and transcendental numbers. A real number is called algebraic if it is a
solution of a polynomial equation PðxÞ ¼ 0 where all the coefficients of the polynomial P
are integers. A real number is called transcendental if it is not an algebraic number. It can
be proved that the set of algebraic numbers is countably infinite, and consequently the set of
transcendental numbers is uncountable. The numbers p and e are transcendental numbers,
but the proofs of these facts are very deep. For an introduction to these topics, we refer the
interested reader to the book by Ivan Niven listed in the References.

Binary Representations

We will digress briefly to discuss informally the binary (and decimal) representations of real
numbers. It will suffice to consider real numbers between 0 and 1, since the representations
for other real numbers can then be obtained by adding a positive or negative number.

CHAPTER 2 THE REAL NUMBERS

If x 2 ½0; 1 , we will use a repeated bisection procedure to associate a sequence (an) of
0s and 1s as follows. If x 6¼ 12 belongs to the left subinterval 0; 12 we take a1 :¼ 0, while if
x belongs to the right subinterval 12 ; 1 we take a1 ¼ 1. If x ¼ 12, then we may take a1 to
be either 0 or 1. In any case, we have
a1
a1 þ 1
:
#x#
2
2
We now bisect the interval 12 a1 ; 12 ða1 þ 1Þ . If x is not the bisection point and belongs to the
left subinterval we take a2 :¼ 0, and if x belongs to the right subinterval we take a2 :¼ 1. If
x ¼ 14 or x ¼ 34, we can take a2 to be either 0 or 1. In any case, we have
a1 a2
a1 a2 þ 1
þ 2#x# þ
:
2 2
2
22
We continue this bisection procedure, assigning at the nth stage the value an :¼ 0 if x is
not the bisection point and lies in the left subinterval, and assigning the value an :¼ 1 if x
lies in the right subinterval. In this way we obtain a sequence (an) of 0s or 1s that
correspond to a nested sequence of intervals containing the point x. For each n, we have
the inequality
ð2Þ

a1 a2
an
a1 a2
an þ 1
þ þ###þ n # x # þ 2 þ###þ
:
2n
2 22
2
2 2

If x is the bisection point at the nth stage, then x ¼ m=2n with m odd. In this case, we may
choose either the left or the right subinterval; however, once this subinterval is chosen,
then all subsequent subintervals in the bisection procedure are determined. [For instance, if
we choose the left subinterval so that an ¼ 0, then x is the right endpoint of all subsequent
subintervals, and hence ak ¼ 1 for all k # n þ 1. On the other hand, if we choose the right
subinterval so that an ¼ 1, then x is the left endpoint of all subsequent subintervals, and
hence ak ¼ 0 for all k # n þ 1. For example, if x ¼ 34, then the two possible sequences for
x are 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, . . . and 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, . . . .]
To summarize: If x 2 ½0; 1 , then there exists a sequence (an) of 0s and 1s such that
inequality (2) holds for all n 2 N. In this case we write
ð3Þ

x ¼ ð:a1 a2 # # # an # # #Þ2 ;

and call (3) a binary representation of x. This representation is unique except when
x ¼ m=2n for m odd, in which case x has the two representations
x ¼ ð:a1 a2 # # # an#1 1000 # # #Þ2 ¼ ð:a1 a2 # # # an#1 0111 # # #Þ2 ;
one ending in 0s and the other ending in 1s.
Conversely, each sequence of 0s and 1s is the binary representation of a unique real
number in [0,1]. The inequality corresponding to (2) determines a closed interval with
length 1=2n and the sequence of these intervals is nested. Therefore, Theorem 2.5.3 implies
that there exists a unique real number x satisfying (2) for every n 2 N. Consequently, x has
the binary representation ð:a1 a2 # # # an # # #Þ2 .
Remark The concept of binary representation is extremely important in this era of digital
computers. A number is entered in a digital computer on ‘‘bits,’’ and each bit can be put in
one of two states—either it will pass current or it will not. These two states correspond to
the values 1 and 0, respectively. Thus, the binary representation of a number can be stored
in a digital computer on a string of bits. Of course, in actual practice, since only finitely
many bits can be stored, the binary representations must be truncated. If n binary digits are

used for a number x 2 ½0; 1 , then the accuracy is at most 1=2n. For example, to assure fourdecimal accuracy, it is necessary to use at least 15 binary digits (or 15 bits).
Decimal Representations
Decimal representations of real numbers are similar to binary representations, except that
we subdivide intervals into ten equal subintervals instead of two.
Thus, given x 2 ½0; 1 , if we subdivide [0,1] into ten equal subintervals, then x belongs
to a subinterval ½b1 =10; ðb1 þ 1Þ=10 for some integer b1 in f0; 1; . . . ; 9g. Proceeding as in
the binary case, we obtain a sequence (bn) of integers with 0 # bn # 9 for all n 2 N such
that x satisfies
ð4Þ

b1
b2
bn
b1
b2
bn þ 1
þ
þ
þ ### þ n # x #
þ ### þ
:
10n
10 102
10
10 102

In this case we say that x has a decimal representation given by
x ¼ :b1 b2 # # # bn # # # :
If x # 1 and if B 2 N is such that B # x &lt; B þ 1, then x ¼ B:b1 b2 # # # bn # # # where the
decimal representation of x # B 2 ½0; 1 is as above. Negative numbers are treated
similarly.
The fact that each decimal determines a unique real number follows from Theorem
2.5.3, since each decimal specifies a nested sequence of intervals with lengths 1=10n.
The decimal representation of x 2 ½0; 1 is unique except when x is a subdivision point at
some stage, which can be seen to occur when x ¼ m=10n for some m; n 2 N; 1 # m # 10n .
(We may also assume that m is not divisible by 10.) When x is a subdivision point at the nth
stage, one choice for bn corresponds to selecting the left subinterval, which causes all
subsequent digits to be 9, and the other choice corresponds to selecting the right subinterval,
which causes all subsequent digits to be 0. [For example, if x ¼ 12 then x ¼
:4999 # # # ¼ :5000 # # #, and if y ¼ 38=100 then y ¼ :37999 # # # ¼ :38000 # # #.]
Periodic Decimals
A decimal B:b1 b2 # # # bn # # # is said to be periodic (or to be repeating), if there exist k; n 2 N
such that bn ¼ bnþm for all n # k. In this case, the block of digits bk bkþ1 # # # bkþm#1 is
repeated once the kth digit is reached. The smallest number m with this property is called the
period of the decimal. For example, 19=88 ¼ :2159090 # # # 90 # # # has period m ¼ 2 with
repeating block 90 starting at k ¼ 4. A terminating decimal is a periodic decimal where the
repeated block is simply the digit 0.
We will give an informal proof of the assertion: A positive real number is rational if
and only if its decimal representation is periodic.
Suppose that x ¼ p=q where p; q 2 N have no common integer factors. For
convenience we will also suppose that 0 &lt; p &lt; q. We note that the process of ‘‘long
division’’ of q into p gives the decimal representation of p=q. Each step in the division
process produces a remainder that is an integer from 0 to q # 1. Therefore, after at most q
steps, some remainder will occur a second time and, at that point, the digits in the quotient
will begin to repeat themselves in cycles. Hence, the decimal representation of such a
rational number is periodic.
Conversely, if a decimal is periodic, then it represents a rational number. The idea of
the proof is best illustrated by an example. Suppose that x ¼ 7:31414 # # # 14 # # #. We
multiply by a power of 10 to move the decimal point to the first repeating block; here

obtaining 10x ¼ 73:1414 # # #. We now multiply by a power of 10 to move one block to the
left of the decimal point; here getting 1000x ¼ 7314:1414 # # #. We now subtract to obtain
an integer; here getting 1000x # 10x ¼ 7314 # 73 ¼ 7241, whence x ¼ 7241=990, a
rational number.
Cantor’s Second Proof
We will now give Cantor’s second proof of the uncountability of R. This is the elegant
‘‘diagonal’’ argument based on decimal representations of real numbers.
2.5.5 Theorem The unit interval ½0; 1 :¼ fx 2 R : 0 # x # 1g is not countable.
Proof. The proof is by contradiction. We will use the fact that every real number x 2 ½0; 1
has a decimal representation x ¼ 0:b1 b2 b3 # # #, where bi ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; 9. Suppose that there is
an enumeration x1 ; x2 ; x3 # # # of all numbers in [0,1], which we display as:
x1 ¼ 0:b11 b12 b13 # # # b1n # # # ;
x2 ¼ 0:b21 b22 b23 # # # b2n # # # ;
x3 ¼ 0:b31 b32 b33 # # # b3n # # # ;
###
###
xn ¼ 0:bn1 bn2 bn3 # # # bnn # # # ;
###
###
We now define a real number y :¼ 0:y1 y2 y3 # # # yn # # # by setting y1 :¼ 2 if b11 # 5 and
y1 :¼ 7 if b11 # 4; in general, we let

yn :¼

if bnn # 4:
Then y 2 ½0; 1 . Note that the number y is not equal to any of the numbers with two decimal
representations, since yn 6¼ 0; 9 for all n 2 N. Further, since y and xn differ in the nth
decimal place, then y 6¼ xn for any n 2 N. Therefore, y is not included in the enumeration of
[0,1], contradicting the hypothesis.

CHAPTER 3

SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Now that the foundations of the real number system R have been laid, we are prepared to
pursue questions of a more analytic nature, and we will begin with a study of the
convergence of sequences. Some of the early results may be familiar to the reader
from calculus, but the presentation here is intended to be rigorous and will lead to certain
more profound theorems than are usually discussed in earlier courses.
We will first introduce the meaning of the convergence of a sequence of real numbers
and establish some basic, but useful, results about convergent sequences. We then present
some deeper results concerning the convergence of sequences. These include the
Monotone Convergence Theorem, the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, and the Cauchy
Criterion for convergence of sequences. It is important for the reader to learn both the
theorems and how the theorems apply to special sequences.
Because of the linear limitations inherent in a book it is necessary to decide where to
locate the subject of infinite series. It would be reasonable to follow this chapter with a full
discussion of infinite series, but this would delay the important topics of continuity,
differentiation, and integration. Consequently, we have decided to compromise. A brief
introduction to infinite series is given in Section 3.7 at the end of this chapter, and a more
extensive treatment is given later in Chapter 9. Thus readers who want a fuller discussion of
series at this point can move to Chapter 9 after completing this chapter.

Augustin-Louis Cauchy
Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) was born in Paris just after the start of
the French Revolution. His father was a lawyer in the Paris police
department, and the family was forced to flee during the Reign of Terror.
As a result, Cauchy’s early years were difficult and he developed strong
anti-revolutionary and pro-royalist feelings. After returning to Paris, Cauchy’s father became secretary to the newly-formed Senate, which included
the mathematicians Laplace and Lagrange. They were impressed by young
Cauchy’s mathematical talent and helped him begin his career.
# Bettmann/CORBIS
#
He entered the Ecole
Polytechnique in 1805 and soon established
a reputation as an exceptional mathematician. In 1815, the year royalty was restored, he was
#
appointed to the faculty of the Ecole
Polytechnique, but his strong political views and his
uncompromising standards in mathematics often resulted in bad relations with his colleagues.
After the July revolution of 1830, Cauchy refused to sign the new loyalty oath and left France for
eight years in self-imposed exile. In 1838, he accepted a minor teaching post in Paris, and in 1848
#
Napoleon III reinstated him to his former position at the Ecole
Polytechnique, where he remained
until his death.
Cauchy was amazingly versatile and prolific, making substantial contributions to many
areas, including real and complex analysis, number theory, differential equations, mathematical
physics and probability. He published eight books and 789 papers, and his collected works fill
26 volumes. He was one of the most important mathematicians in the first half of the nineteenth
century.

3.1 SEQUENCES AND THEIR LIMITS

55

Section 3.1 Sequences and Their Limits
A sequence in a set S is a function whose domain is the set N of natural numbers, and whose
range is contained in the set S. In this chapter, we will be concerned with sequences in R
and will discuss what we mean by the convergence of these sequences.
3.1.1 Definition A sequence of real numbers (or a sequence in R) is a function defined
on the set N ¼ f1; 2; . . .g of natural numbers whose range is contained in the set R of real
numbers.
In other words, a sequence in R assigns to each natural number n ¼ 1, 2, . . . a
uniquely determined real number. If X : N ! R is a sequence, we will usually denote the
value of X at n by the symbol xn rather than using the function notation XðnÞ. The values xn
are also called the terms or the elements of the sequence. We will denote this sequence by
the notations
X;

ðxn Þ;

ðxn : n 2 NÞ:

Of course, we will often use other letters, such as Y ¼ ðyk Þ; Z ¼ ðzi Þ, and so on, to denote
sequences.
We purposely use parentheses to emphasize that the ordering induced by the natural
order of N is a matter of importance. Thus, we distinguish notationally between the
sequence ðxn : n 2 NÞ, whose infinitely many terms have an ordering, and the set of values
fxn : n 2 Ng in the range of the sequence that are not ordered. For example, the sequence
X :¼ ðð#1Þn : n 2 N Þ has infinitely many terms that alternate between #1 and 1, whereas
the set of values fð#1Þn : n 2 Ng is equal to the set {#1, 1}, which has only two elements.
Sequences are often defined by giving a formula for the nth term xn. Frequently, it is
convenient to list the terms of a sequence in order, stopping when the rule of formation
seems evident. For example, we may define the sequence of reciprocals of the even
numbers by writing
#
#
1 1 1 1
; ; ; ;### ;
X :¼
2 4 6 8
though a more satisfactory method is to specify the formula for the general term and write
#
X :¼

1
:n2N
2n

#

or more simply X ¼ ð1=2nÞ.
Another way of defining a sequence is to specify the value of x1 and give a formula for
xnþ1 ðn # 1Þ in terms of xn. More generally, we may specify x1 and give a formula for
obtaining xnþ1 from x1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn . Sequences defined in this manner are said to be
inductively (or recursively) defined.
3.1.2 Examples (a) If b 2 R, the sequence B :¼ ðb; b; b; . . .Þ, all of whose terms equal
b, is called the constant sequence b. Thus the constant sequence 1 is the sequence
ð1; 1; 1; . . .Þ, and the constant sequence 0 is the sequence ð0; 0; 0; . . .Þ.

CHAPTER 3 SEQUENCES AND SERIES

(b) If b 2 R, then B :¼ ðbn Þ is the sequence B ¼ ðb; b2 ; b3 ; . . . ; bn ; . . .Þ. In particular, if
b ¼ 12, then we obtain the sequence
#

2n

#

#
#
1 1 1
1
; ; ;...; n;... :
¼
2 4 8

(c) The sequence of ð2n : n 2 NÞ of even natural numbers can be defined inductively by
x1 :¼ 2;

xnþ1 :¼ xn þ 2;

y1 :¼ 2;

ynþ1 :¼ y1 þ yn :

or by the definition
(d) The celebrated Fibonacci sequence F :¼ ð f n Þ is given by the inductive definition
f 1 :¼ 1;

f 2 :¼ 1;

f nþ1 :¼ f n#1 þ f n

ðn # 2Þ:

Thus each term past the second is the sum of its two immediate predecessors. The first ten
terms of F are seen to be ð1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34; 55; . . .Þ.
&amp;
The Limit of a Sequence
There are a number of different limit concepts in real analysis. The notion of limit of a
sequence is the most basic, and it will be the focus of this chapter.
3.1.3 Definition A sequence X ¼ ðxn Þ in R is said to converge to x 2 R, or x is said to
be a limit of ðxn Þ, if for every e &gt; 0 there exists a natural number KðeÞ such that for all
n # KðeÞ, the terms xn satisfy jxn # xj &lt; e.
If a sequence has a limit, we say that the sequence is convergent; if it has no limit, we
say that the sequence is divergent.
Note The notation KðeÞ is used to emphasize that the choice of K depends on the value
of e. However, it is often convenient to write K instead of KðeÞ. In most cases, a ‘‘small’’
value of e will usually require a ‘‘large’’ value of K to guarantee that the distance jxn # xj
between xn and x is less than e for all n # K ¼ KðeÞ.
When a sequence has limit x, we will use the notation
lim X ¼ x

or

limðxn Þ ¼ x:

We will sometimes use the symbolism xn ! x, which indicates the intuitive idea that the
values xn ‘‘approach’’ the number x as n ! 1.
3.1.4 Uniqueness of Limits A sequence in R can have at most one limit.
Proof. Suppose that x0 and x 00 are both limits of ðxn Þ. For each e &gt; 0 there exist K0 such
that jxn # x0 j &lt; e=2 for all n # K 0 , and there exists K 00 such that jxn # x 00 j &lt; e=2 for all
n # K 00 . We let K be the larger of K0 and K 00 . Then for n # K we apply the Triangle
Inequality to get
jx0 # x 00 j ¼ jx0 # xn þ xn # x 00 j
# jx0 # xn j þ jxn # x 00 j &lt; e=2 þ e=2 ¼ e:
Since e &gt; 0 is an arbitrary positive number, we conclude that x0 # x 00 ¼ 0.

For x 2 R and e &gt; 0, recall that the e-neighborhood of x is the set
V e ðxÞ :¼ fu 2 R : ju # xj &lt; eg:
(See Section 2.2.) Since u 2 V e ðxÞ is equivalent to ju # xj &lt; e, the definition of convergence of a sequence can be formulated in terms of neighborhoods. We give several different
ways of saying that a sequence xn converges to x in the following theorem.
3.1.5 Theorem Let X ¼ (xn) be a sequence of real numbers, and let x 2 R. The
following statements are equivalent.
(a) X converges to x.
(b) For every e &gt; 0, there exists a natural number K such that for all n # K, the terms xn
satisfy jxn # xj &lt; e.
(c) For every e &gt; 0, there exists a natural number K such that for all n # K, the terms xn
satisfy x # e &lt; xn &lt; x þ e.
(d) For every e-neighborhood V e ðxÞ of x, there exists a natural number K such that for
all n # K, the terms xn belong to V e ðxÞ.
Proof. The equivalence of (a) and (b) is just the definition. The equivalence of (b), (c), and
(d) follows from the following implications:
ju # xj &lt; e

()

#e &lt; u # x &lt; e ()

x # e &lt; u &lt; x þ e () u 2 V e ðxÞ:
Q.E.D.

With the language of neighborhoods, one can describe the convergence of the
sequence X ¼ ðxn Þ to the number x by saying: for each e-neighborhood Ve(x) of x, all
but a finite number of terms of X belong to Ve (x). The finite number of terms that may not
belong to the e-neighborhood are the terms x1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xK#1 .
Remark The definition of the limit of a sequence of real numbers is used to verify that a
proposed value x is indeed the limit. It does not provide a means for initially determining
what that value of x might be. Later results will contribute to this end, but quite often it is
necessary in practice to arrive at a conjectured value of the limit by direct calculation of a
number of terms of the sequence. Computers can be helpful in this respect, but since they
can calculate only a finite number of terms of a sequence, such computations do not in any
way constitute a proof of the value of the limit.
The following examples illustrate how the definition is applied to prove that a
sequence has a particular limit. In each case, a positive e is given and we are required
to find a K, depending on e, as required by the definition.
3.1.6 Examples (a) lim(l=n) ¼ 0.
If e &gt; 0 is given, then 1=e &gt; 0. By the Archimedean Property 2.4.3, there is a natural
number K ¼ KðeÞ such that 1=K &lt; e. Then, if n # K, we have 1=n # 1=K &lt; e. Consequently, if n # K, then
#
#
#1
#
# # 0# ¼ 1 &lt; e:
#n
# n
Therefore, we can assert that the sequence (1=n) converges to 0.

Let e &gt; 0 be given. To find K, we first note that if n 2 N, then

Now if the inequality 1=n &lt; e is satisfied, then the inequality (1) holds. Thus if 1=K &lt; e,
then for any n # K, we also have 1=n &lt; e and hence (1) holds. Therefore the limit of the

K &gt; 1=e , then n þ 1 # n &lt; e for all n &gt; K. (For example, if we are given e ¼ 1=10,
then K &gt; 100 is required.)
(e) If 0 &lt; b &lt; 1, then limðbn Þ ¼ 0.
We will use elementary properties of the natural logarithm function. If e &gt; 0 is given,
we see that
bn &lt; e () n ln b &lt; ln e () n &gt; ln e=ln b:
(The last inequality is reversed because ln b &lt; 0.) Thus if we choose K to be a number such
that K &gt; ln e=ln b, then we will have 0 &lt; bn &lt; e for all n # K. Thus we have limðbn Þ ¼ 0.
For example, if b ¼ .8, and if e ¼ .01 is given, then we would need K &gt;
&amp;
ln :01=ln :8 # 20:6377. Thus K ¼ 21 would be an appropriate choice for e ¼ .01.
Remark The KðeÞ Game In the notion of convergence of a sequence, one way to keep
in mind the connection between the e and the K is to think of it as a game called the KðeÞ
Game. In this game, Player A asserts that a certain number x is the limit of a sequence (xn).
Player B challenges this assertion by giving Player A a specific value for e &gt; 0. Player A
must respond to the challenge by coming up with a value of K such that jxn # xj &lt; e for all
n &gt; K. If Player A can always find a value of K that works, then he wins, and the sequence
is convergent. However, if Player B can give a specific value of e &gt; 0 for which Player A

cannot respond adequately, then Player B wins, and we conclude that the sequence does
not converge to x.
In order to show that a sequence X ¼ ðxn Þ does not converge to the number x, it is
enough to produce one number e0 &gt; 0 such that no matter what natural number K is chosen,
one can find a particular nK satisfying nK # K such that jxnK # xj # e0 . (This will be
discussed in more detail in Section 3.4.)
3.1.7 Example The sequence ð0; 2; 0; 2; . . . ; 0; 2; . . .Þ does not converge to the
number 0.
If Player A asserts that 0 is the limit of the sequence, he will lose the KðeÞ Game when
Player B gives him a value of e &lt; 2. To be definite, let Player B give Player A the value
e0 ¼ 1. Then no matter what value Player A chooses for K, his response will not be
adequate, for Player B will respond by selecting an even number n &gt; K. Then the
corresponding value is xn ¼ 2 so that jxn # 0j ¼ 2 &gt; 1 ¼ e0 . Thus the number 0 is not
&amp;
the limit of the sequence.
Tails of Sequences
It is important to realize that the convergence (or divergence) of a sequence X ¼ ðxn Þ
depends only on the ‘‘ultimate behavior’’ of the terms. By this we mean that if, for any
natural number m, we drop the first m terms of the sequence, then the resulting sequence Xm
converges if and only if the original sequence converges, and in this case, the limits are the
same. We will state this formally after we introduce the idea of a ‘‘tail’’ of a sequence.
3.1.8 Definition If X ¼ ðx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn ; . . .Þ is a sequence of real numbers and if m is a
given natural number, then the m-tail of X is the sequence
X m :¼ ðxmþn : n 2 NÞ ¼ ðxmþ1 ; xmþ2 ; . . .Þ
For example, the 3-tail of the sequence X ¼ ð2; 4; 6; 8; 10; . . . ; 2n; . . .Þ, is the sequence
X 3 ¼ ð8; 10; 12; . . . ; 2n þ 6; . . .Þ.
3.1.9 Theorem Let X ¼ ðxn : n 2 NÞ be a sequence of real numbers and let m 2 N.
Then the m-tail X m ¼ ðxmþn : n 2 NÞ of X converges if and only if X converges. In this
case, lim X m ¼ lim X.
Proof. We note that for any p 2 N, the pth term of Xm is the ( p þ m)th term of X.
Similarly, if q &gt; m, then the qth term of X is the ðq # mÞth term of Xm.
Assume X converges to x. Then given any e &gt; 0, if the terms of X for n # KðeÞ satisfy
jxn # xj &lt; e, then the terms of Xm for k # KðeÞ # m satisfy jxk # xj &lt; e. Thus we can take
K m ðeÞ ¼ KðeÞ # m, so that Xm also converges to x.
Conversely, if the terms of Xm for k # K m ðeÞ satisfy jxk # xj &lt; e, then the terms of X
for n # KðeÞ þ m satisfy jxn # xj &lt; e. Thus we can take KðeÞ ¼ K m ðeÞ þ m.
Therefore, X converges to x if and only if Xm converges to x.
Q.E.D.
We shall sometimes say that a sequence X ultimately has a certain property
if some tail of X has this property. For example, we say that the sequence
ð3; 4; 5; 5; 5; . . . ; 5; . . .Þ is ‘‘ultimately constant.’’ On the other hand, the sequence
ð3; 5; 3; 5; . . . ; 3; 5; . . .Þ is not ultimately constant. The notion of convergence can be
stated using this terminology: A sequence X converges to x if and only if the terms of
X are ultimately in every e-neighborhood of x. Other instances of this ‘‘ultimate
terminology’’ will be noted later.

CHAPTER 3 SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Further Examples
In establishing that a number x is the limit of a sequence (xn), we often try to simplify
the difference jxn # xj before considering an e &gt; 0 and finding a KðeÞ as required by the
definition of limit. This was done in some of the earlier examples. The next result is a
more formal statement of this idea, and the examples that follow make use of this
approach.
3.1.10 Theorem Let (xn) be a sequence of real numbers and let x 2 R. If (an) is a
sequence of positive real numbers with limðan Þ ¼ 0 and if for some constant C &gt; 0 and
some m 2 N we have
jxn # xj # Can

for all

n # m;

then it follows that limðxn Þ ¼ x.
Proof. If e &gt; 0 is given, then since limðan Þ ¼ 0, we know there exists K ¼ Kðe=CÞ such
that n # K implies
an ¼ jan # 0j &lt; e=C:
Therefore it follows that if both n # K and n # m, then
jxn # xj # Can &lt; Cðe=CÞ ¼ e:
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that x ¼ limðxn Þ.

Q.E.D.

3.1.11 Examples (a) If a &gt; 0, then lim
¼ 0.
1 þ na
Since a &gt; 0, then 0 &lt; na &lt; 1 þ na, and therefore 0 &lt; 1=(1 þ na) &lt; 1=(na). Thus
we have
#
# # #
# 1
#
#
# # 1 1 for all n 2 N:
#
0
#1 þ na
#
a n
Since limð1=nÞ ¼ 0, we may invoke Theorem 3.1.10 with C ¼ 1=a and m ¼ 1 to infer that
lim ð1=ð1 þ naÞÞ ¼ 0.
(b) If 0 &lt; b &lt; 1, then limðbn Þ ¼ 0.
This limit was obtained earlier in Example 3.1.6(e). We will give a second proof that
illustrates the use of Bernoulli’s Inequality (see Example 2.1.13(c)).
Since 0 &lt; b &lt; 1, we can write b ¼ 1=(1 þ a), where a :¼ (1=b) #1 so that a &gt; 0. By
Bernoulli’s Inequality, we have ð1 þ aÞn # 1 þ na. Hence
0 &lt; bn ¼

1
1
1
&lt; :
#
ð1 þ aÞn 1 þ na na

Thus from Theorem 3.1.10 we conclude that limðbn Þ ¼ 0.
In particular, if b ¼ .8, so that a ¼ .25, and if we are given e ¼ .01, then the preceding
inequality gives us KðeÞ ¼ 4=ð:01Þ ¼ 400. Comparing with Example 3.1.6(e), where we
obtained K ¼ 21, we see this method of estimation does not give us the ‘‘best’’ value of K.
However, for the purpose of establishing the limit, the size of K is immaterial.
(c) If c &gt; 0, then limðc1=n Þ ¼ 1.
The case c ¼ 1 is trivial, since then (c1/n) is the constant sequence ð1; 1; . . .Þ, which
evidently converges to 1.

If c &gt; 1, then c1/n ¼ 1 þ dn for some dn &gt; 0. Hence by Bernoulli’s Inequality 2.1.13(c),
c ¼ ð1 þ d n Þn # 1 þ nd n

Bernoulli’s Inequality implies that

We now apply Theorem 3.1.10 to infer that limðc1=n Þ ¼ 1 when 0 &lt; c &lt; 1.
(d) limðn1=n Þ ¼ 1
Since n1=n &gt; 1 for n &gt; 1, we can write n1=n ¼ 1 þ kn for some kn &gt; 0 when n &gt; 1.
Hence n ¼ ð1 þ kn Þn for n &gt; 1. By the Binomial Theorem, if n &gt; 1 we have
n ¼ 1 þ nkn þ 12 nðn # 1Þk2n þ # # # # 1 þ 12 nðn # 1Þk2n ;
whence it follows that
n # 1 # 12 nðn # 1Þk2n :
Hence k2n # 2=n for n &gt; 1. If e &gt; 0 is given, it follows from the Archimedean Property that
there exists a natural number Ne such that 2=Ne &lt; e2. It follows that if n # supf2; N e g then
2=n &lt; e2, whence
0 &lt; n1=n # 1 ¼ kn # ð2=nÞ1=2 &lt; e:
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we deduce that limðn1=n Þ ¼ 1.

Section 3.2 Limit Theorems
In this section we will obtain some results that enable us to evaluate the limits of certain
sequences of real numbers. These results will expand our collection of convergent
sequences rather extensively. We begin by establishing an important property of convergent sequences that will be needed in this and later sections.
3.2.1 Definition A sequence X ¼ ðxn Þ of real numbers is said to be bounded if there
exists a real number M &gt; 0 such that jxn j # M for all n 2 N.
Thus, the sequence (xn) is bounded if and only if the set fxn : n 2 Ng of its values is a
bounded subset of R.
3.2.2 Theorem A convergent sequence of real numbers is bounded.
Proof. Suppose that limðxn Þ ¼ x and let e :¼ 1. Then there exists a natural number
K ¼ K(1) such that jxn # xj &lt; 1 for all n # K. If we apply the Triangle Inequality with
n # K we obtain
jxn j ¼ jxn # x þ xj # jxn # xj þ jxj &lt; 1 þ jxj:
If we set
M :¼ sup jx1 j; jx2 j; . . . ; jxK#1 j; 1 þ jxj ;
then it follows that jxn j # M for all n 2 N.

Q.E.D.

Remark We can also prove a convergent sequence (xn) is bounded using the language of
neighborhoods. If Ve(x) is a given neighborhood of the limit x, then all but a finite number
of terms of the sequence belong to Ve(x). Therefore, since Ve(x) is clearly bounded and
finite sets are bounded, it follows that the sequence is bounded.
We will now examine how the limit process interacts with the operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division of sequences. If X ¼ (xn) and Y ¼ (yn) are
sequences of real numbers, then we define their sum to be the sequence X þ Y : ¼ (xn þ yn),
their difference to be the sequence X # Y :¼ ðxn # yn Þ, and their product to be the
sequence X # Y :¼ (xnyn). If c 2 R, we define the multiple of X by c to be the sequence
cX :¼ (cxn). Finally, if Z ¼ (zn) is a sequence of real numbers with zn 6¼ 0 for all n 2 N,
then we define the quotient of X and Z to be the sequence X=Z :¼ ðxn =zn Þ.
For example, if X and Y are the sequences

X :¼ ð2; 4; 6; . . . ; 2n; . . .Þ; Y :¼

CHAPTER 3 SEQUENCES AND SERIES

We note that if Z is the sequence
#
#
Z :¼ 0; 2; 0; . . . ; 1 þ ð#1Þn ; . . . ;
then we can define X þ Z, X – Z and X # Z, but X=Z is not defined since some of the terms of
Z are zero.
We now show that sequences obtained by applying these operations to convergent
sequences give rise to new sequences whose limits can be predicted.
3.2.3 Theorem (a) Let X ¼ (xn) and Y ¼ (yn) be sequences of real numbers that
converge to x and y, respectively, and let c 2 R. Then the sequences X þ Y, X – Y, X # Y, and
cX converge to x þ y, x – y, xy, and cx, respectively.
(b) If X ¼ (xn) converges to x and Z ¼ (zn) is a sequence of nonzero real numbers that
converges to z and if z 6¼ 0, then the quotient sequence X=Z converges to x=z.
Proof. (a) To show that limðxn þ yn Þ ¼ x þ y, we need to estimate the magnitude of
jðxn þ yn Þ # ðx þ yÞj. To do this we use the Triangle Inequality 2.2.3 to obtain
jðxn þ yn Þ # ðx þ yÞj ¼ jðxn # xÞ þ ðyn # yÞj
# jxn # x j þ j yn # yj:
By hypothesis, if e &gt; 0 there exists a natural number K1 such that if n # K 1 , then jxn # xj &lt;
e=2; also there exists a natural number K2 such that if n # K 2 , then jyn # yj &lt; e=2. Hence if
KðeÞ :¼ supfK 1 ; K 2 g, it follows that if n # KðeÞ then
jðxn þ yn Þ # ðx þ yÞj # jxn # xj þ jyn # yj
1
1
&lt; e þ e ¼ e:
2
2
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we infer that X þ Y ¼ ðxn þ yn Þ converges to x þ y.
Precisely the same argument can be used to show that X # Y ¼ ðxn # yn Þ converges to
x # y.
To show that X # Y ¼ ðxn yn Þ converges to xy, we make the estimate
jxn yn # xyj ¼ jðxn yn # xn yÞ þ ðxn y # xyÞj
# jxn ðyn # yÞj þ jðxn # xÞyj
¼ jxn jjyn # yj þ jxn # xjjyj:
According to Theorem 3.2.2 there exists a real number M 1 &gt; 0 such that jxn j # M 1 for all
n 2 N and we set M :¼ supfM 1 ; jyjg. Hence we have
jxn yn # xyj # Mjyn # yj þ Mjxn # xj:
From the convergence of X and Y we conclude that if e &gt; 0 is given, then there exist natural
numbers K1 and K2 such that if n # K 1 then jxn # xj &lt; e=2M, and if n # K 2 then
jyn # yj &lt; e=2M. Now let KðeÞ ¼ supfK 1 ; K 2 g; then, if n # KðeÞ we infer that
jxn yn # xyj # Mjyn # yj þ Mjxn # xj
&lt; Mðe=2MÞ þ Mðe=2MÞ ¼ e:
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, this proves that the sequence X # Y ¼ ðxn yn Þ converges to xy.
The fact that cX ¼ (cxn) converges to cx can be proved in the same way; it can also be
deduced by taking Y to be the constant sequence ðc; c; c; . . .Þ. We leave the details to the
reader.

(b) We next show that if Z ¼ ðzn Þ is a sequence of nonzero numbers that converges to a
nonzero limit z, then the sequence (l=zn) of reciprocals converges to 1=z. First let a :¼ 12 jzj
so that a &gt; 0. Since limðzn Þ ¼ z, there exists a natural number K1 such that if
n # K 1 then jzn # zj &lt; a. It follows from Corollary 2.2.4(a) of the Triangle Inequality
that #a # #jzn # zj # jzn j # jzj for n # K 1, whence it follows that 12 jzj ¼ jzj # a # jzn j
for n # K 1. Therefore 1=jzn j # 2=jzj for n # K 1 so we have the estimate

Now, if e &gt; 0 is given, there exists a natural number K2 such that if n # K 2 then

The proof of (b) is now completed by taking Y to be the sequence ð1=zn Þ and using the fact
that X # Y ¼ ðxn =zn Þ converges to xð1=zÞ ¼ x=z.
Q.E.D.
Some of the results of Theorem 3.2.3 can be extended, by Mathematical Induction, to a
finite number of convergent sequences. For example, if A ¼ ðan Þ; B ¼ ðbn Þ; . . . ; Z ¼ ðzn Þ
are convergent sequences of real numbers, then their sum A þ B þ # # # þ Z ¼ ðan þ bn

3.2.4 Theorem If X ¼ (xn) is a convergent sequence of real numbers and if xn # 0 for all
n 2 N, then x ¼ limðxn Þ # 0.
Proof. Suppose the conclusion is not true and that x &lt; 0; then e :¼ #x is positive. Since X
converges to x, there is a natural number K such that
x # e &lt; xn &lt; x þ e for all

n # K:

In particular, we have xK &lt; x þ e ¼ x þ ð#xÞ ¼ 0. But this contradicts the hypothesis
that xn # 0 for all n 2 N. Therefore, this contradiction implies that x # 0.
Q.E.D.
We now give a useful result that is formally stronger than Theorem 3.2.4.
3.2.5 Theorem If X ¼ ðxn Þ and Y ¼ ðyn Þ are convergent sequences of real numbers and
if xn # yn for all n 2 N, then limðxn Þ # limðyn Þ.

Proof. Let zn :¼ yn # xn so that Z :¼ ðzn Þ ¼ Y # X and zn # 0 for all n 2 N. It follows
from Theorems 3.2.3 and 3.2.4 that
0 # lim Z ¼ limðyn Þ # limðxn Þ;
so that limðxn Þ # limðyn Þ:

Q.E.D.

The next result asserts that if all the terms of a convergent sequence satisfy an inequality
of the form a # xn # b, then the limit of the sequence satisfies the same inequality. Thus if the
sequence is convergent, one may ‘‘pass to the limit’’ in an inequality of this type.
3.2.6 Theorem If X ¼ ðxn Þ is a convergent sequence and if a # xn # b for all n 2 N,
then a # limðxn Þ # b.
Proof. Let Y be the constant sequence ðb; b; b; . . .Þ. Theorem 3.2.5 implies that
lim X # lim Y ¼ b. Similarly one shows that a # lim X.
Q.E.D.
The next result asserts that if a sequence Y is squeezed between two sequences that
converge to the same limit, then it must also converge to this limit.
3.2.7 Squeeze Theorem Suppose that X ¼ ðxn Þ; Y ¼ ðyn Þ, and Z ¼ ðzn Þ are sequences
of real numbers such that
xn # yn # zn

for all

n 2 N;

and that limðxn Þ ¼ limðzn Þ. Then Y ¼ ðyn Þ is convergent and
limðxn Þ ¼ limðyn Þ ¼ limðzn Þ:
Proof. Let w :¼ limðxn Þ ¼ limðzn Þ. If e &gt; 0 is given, then it follows from the convergence of X and Z to w that there exists a natural number K such that if n # K then
jxn # wj &lt; e

and

jzn # wj &lt; e:

Since the hypothesis implies that
xn # w # yn # w # zn # w

for all

n 2 N;

it follows (why?) that
#e &lt; yn # w &lt; e
for all n # K. Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, this implies that limðyn Þ ¼ w.

Q.E.D.

Remark Since any tail of a convergent sequence has the same limit, the hypotheses of
Theorems 3.2.4, 3.2.5, 3.2.6, and 3.2.7 can be weakened to apply to the tail of a sequence.
For example, in Theorem 3.2.4, if X ¼ ðxn Þ is ‘‘ultimately positive’’ in the sense that there
exists m 2 N such that xn # 0 for all n # m, then the same conclusion that x # 0 will hold.
Similar modifications are valid for the other theorems, as the reader should verify.
3.2.8 Examples (a) The sequence ðnÞ is divergent.
It follows from Theorem 3.2.2 that if the sequence X :¼ ðnÞ is convergent, then there
exists a real number M &gt; 0 such that n ¼ jnj &lt; M for all n 2 N. But this violates the
Archimedean Property 2.4.3.

(b) The sequence ðð#1Þn Þ is divergent.
This sequence X ¼ ðð#1Þn Þ is bounded (take M :¼ 1), so we cannot invoke
Theorem 3.2.2. However, assume that a :¼ lim X exists. Let e :¼ 1 so that there exists
a natural number K1 such that
jð#1Þn # aj &lt; 1 for all

n # K1:

If n is an odd natural number with n # K 1 this gives j #1 # aj &lt; 1, so that #2 &lt; a &lt; 0. On
the other hand, if n is an even natural number with n # K 1 , this inequality gives
j1 # aj &lt; 1 so that 0 &lt; a &lt; 2. Since a cannot satisfy both of these inequalities, the
hypothesis that X is convergent leads to a contradiction. Therefore the sequence X is
divergent.

If we let X :¼ (2) and Y :¼ (1=n), then ðð2n þ 1Þ=nÞ ¼ X þ Y. Hence it follows

we can obtain the given sequence as one to which Theorem 3.2.3(b) applies when we
take X :¼ ð2 þ 1=nÞ and Z :¼ ð1 þ 5=nÞ. (Check that all hypotheses are satisfied.) Since
lim X ¼ 2 and lim Z ¼ 1 6¼ 0, we deduce that limðð2n þ 1Þ=ðn þ 5ÞÞ ¼ 2=1 ¼ 2.

Hence we can apply the Squeeze Theorem 3.2.7 to infer that limðn#1 sin nÞ ¼ 0. (We note
that Theorem 3.1.10 could also be applied to this sequence.)
(g) Let X ¼ ðxn Þ be a sequence of real numbers that converges to x 2 R. Let p be a
polynomial; for example, let
pðtÞ :¼ ak tk þ ak#1 tk#1 þ # # # þ a1 t þ a0 ;
where k 2 N and aj 2 R for j ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; k. It follows from Theorem 3.2.3 that the
sequence ð pðxn ÞÞ converges to pðxÞ. We leave the details to the reader as an exercise.
(h) Let X ¼ ðxn Þ be a sequence of real numbers that converges to x 2 R. Let r be a
rational function (that is, rðtÞ :¼ pðtÞ=qðtÞ, where p and q are polynomials). Suppose that
qðxn Þ 6¼ 0 for all n 2 N and that qðxÞ 6¼ 0. Then the sequence ðrðxn ÞÞ converges to

rðxÞ ¼ pðxÞ=qðxÞ. We leave the details to the reader as an exercise.
We conclude this section with several results that will be useful in the work that
follows.
3.2.9 Theorem Let the sequence X ¼ ðxn Þ converge to x. Then the sequence ðjxn jÞ of
absolute values converges to jxj. That is, if x ¼ limðxn Þ, then jxj ¼ limðjxn jÞ.
Proof. It follows from the Triangle Inequality (see Corollary 2.2.4(a)) that
#
#
#jxn j # jxj# # jxn # xj
for all n 2 N:
The convergence of ðjxn jÞ to jxj is then an immediate consequence of the convergence of
ðxn Þ to x.
Q.E.D.
3.2.10 Theorem Let X ¼ ðxn Þ be a sequence of real numbers that converges to x and
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
suppose thatpxﬃﬃﬃn # 0. Then the sequence ð xn Þ of positive square roots converges and
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
limð xn Þ ¼ x.
Proof. It follows from Theorem 3.2.4 that x ¼ limðxn Þ # 0 so the assertion makes sense.
We now consider the two cases: (i) x ¼ 0 and (ii) x &gt; 0.
Case (i) If x ¼ 0, let e &gt; 0 be given. Since xn ! 0 there exists a natural number K
such that if n # K then
0 # xn ¼ xn # 0 &lt; e2 :
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Therefore [see Example 2.1.13(a)], 0 # xn &lt; e for n # K. Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, this
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
implies that xn ! 0.

3.2.11 Theorem Let ðxn Þ be a sequence of positive real numbers such that L :¼
limðxnþ1 =xn Þ exists. If L &lt; 1, then ðxn Þ converges and limðxn Þ ¼ 0.
Proof. By 3.2.4 it follows that L # 0. Let r be a number such that L &lt; r &lt; 1, and let
e :¼ r # L &gt; 0. There exists a number K 2 N such that if n # K then
#
#

#
#
#
# x # L# &lt; e:
n
It follows from this (why?) that if n # K, then
xnþ1
&lt; L þ e ¼ L þ ðr # LÞ ¼ r:
xn
Therefore, if n # K, we obtain
0 &lt; xnþ1 &lt; xn r &lt; xn#1 r2 &lt; # # # &lt; xK r n#Kþ1 :
If we set C :¼ xK =rK , we see that 0 &lt; xnþ1 &lt; Cr nþ1 for all n # K. Since 0 &lt; r &lt; 1, it
follows from 3.1.11(b) that limðrn Þ ¼ 0 and therefore from Theorem 3.1.10 that
limðxn Þ ¼ 0.
Q.E.D.
As an illustration of the utility of the preceding theorem, consider the sequence ðxn Þ

Section 3.3 Monotone Sequences
Until now, we have obtained several methods of showing that a sequence X ¼ (xn) of real
numbers is convergent:


C03

Page 71

3.3 MONOTONE SEQUENCES

71

(i) We can use Definition 3.1.3 or Theorem 3.1.5 directly. This is often (but not
always) difficult to do.
(ii) We can dominate jxn # xj by a multiple of the terms in a sequence ðan Þ known to
converge to 0, and employ Theorem 3.1.10.
(iii) We can identify X as a sequence obtained from other sequences that are known to
be convergent by taking tails, algebraic combinations, absolute values, or square roots, and
employ Theorems 3.1.9, 3.2.3, 3.2.9, or 3.2.10.
(iv) We can ‘‘squeeze’’ X between two sequences that converge to the same limit and
use Theorem 3.2.7.
(v) We can use the ‘‘ratio test’’ of Theorem 3.2.11.
Except for (iii), all of these methods require that we already know (or at least suspect) the
value of the limit, and we then verify that our suspicion is correct.
There are many instances, however, in which there is no obvious candidate for the limit
of a sequence, even though a preliminary analysis may suggest that convergence is likely.
In this and the next two sections, we shall establish results that can be used to show a
sequence is convergent even though the value of the limit is not known. The method we
introduce in this section is more restricted in scope than the methods we give in the next
two, but it is much easier to employ. It applies to sequences that are monotone in the
following sense.
3.3.1 Definition Let X ¼ (xn) be a sequence of real numbers. We say that X is increasing
if it satisfies the inequalities
x1 # x2 # # # # # xn # xnþ1 # # # # :
We say that X is decreasing if it satisfies the inequalities
x1 # x2 # # # # # xn # xnþ1 # # # # :
We say that X is monotone if it is either increasing or decreasing.
The following sequences are increasing:
ð1; 2; 3; 4; . . . ; n; . . .Þ; ð1; 2; 2; 3; 3; 3; . . .Þ;
ða; a2 ; a3 ; . . . ; an ; . . .Þ

The following sequences are not monotone, but they are ‘‘ultimately’’ monotone:
ð7; 6; 2; 1; 2; 3; 4; . . .Þ;

ð#2; 0; 1; 1=2; 1=3; 1=4; . . .Þ:

3.3.2 Monotone Convergence Theorem A monotone sequence of real numbers is
convergent if and only if it is bounded. Further:

CHAPTER 3 SEQUENCES AND SERIES

(a) If X ¼ (xn) is a bounded increasing sequence, then
limðxn Þ ¼ supfxn : n 2 Ng:
(b) If Y ¼ (yn) is a bounded decreasing sequence, then
limðyn Þ ¼ inffyn : n 2 Ng:
Proof. It was seen in Theorem 3.2.2 that a convergent sequence must be bounded.
Conversely, let X be a bounded monotone sequence. Then X is either increasing or
decreasing.
(a) We first treat the case where X ¼ (xn) is a bounded, increasing sequence. Since X is
bounded, there exists a real number M such that xn # M for all n 2 N. According to the
Completeness Property 2.3.6, the supremum x# ¼ supfxn : n 2 Ng exists in R; we will
show that x# ¼ limðxn Þ.
If e &gt; 0 is given, then x# # e is not an upper bound of the set fxn : n 2 Ng, and hence
there exists xK such that x# # e &lt; xK . The fact that X is an increasing sequence implies that
xK # xn whenever n # K, so that
x# # e &lt; xK # xn # x# &lt; x# þ e for all

n # K:

Therefore we have
jxn # x# j &lt; e

for all

n # K:

Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that (xn) converges to x#.
(b) If Y ¼ (yn) is a bounded decreasing sequence, then it is clear that X :¼ #Y ¼
ð#yn Þ is a bounded increasing sequence. It was shown in part (a) that lim X ¼
supf#yn : n 2 Ng, Now lim X ¼ #lim Y and also, by Exercise 2.4.4(b), we have
supf#yn : n 2 Ng ¼ #inffyn : n 2 Ng:
Therefore lim Y ¼ #lim X ¼ inffyn : n 2 Ng:

Q.E.D.

The Monotone Convergence Theorem establishes the existence of the limit of a
bounded monotone sequence. It also gives us a way of calculating the limit of the sequence
provided we can evaluate the supremum in case (a), or the infimum in case (b). Sometimes
it is difficult to evaluate this supremum (or infimum), but once we know that it exists, it is
often possible to evaluate the limit by other methods.
pﬃﬃﬃ
3.3.3 Examples (a) limð1= nÞ ¼ 0.
It is possible to handle this sequence by using Theorem 3.2.10; however, we shallpuse
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
the Monotone Convergence Theorem. Clearly 0 is a lower bound for thepset
ﬃﬃﬃ f1= n :
n 2 Ng, and it is not
pﬃﬃﬃ difficult to show that 0 is the infimum of the set f1= n : n 2 Ng;
hence 0 ¼ limð1= nÞ.
pﬃﬃﬃ
On the other hand, once we know that X :¼ ð1= nÞ is bounded
pﬃﬃﬃ and decreasing, we
know that it converges to some real number x. Since X ¼ ð1= nÞ converges to x, it
follows from Theorem 3.2.3 that X # X ¼ ð1=nÞ converges to x2 . Therefore x2 ¼ 0,
whence x ¼ 0.
(b) Let hn :¼ 1 þ 1=2 þ 1=3 þ # # # þ 1=n for n 2 N.
Since hnþ1 ¼ hn þ 1=ðn þ 1Þ &gt; hn , we see that ðhn Þ is an increasing sequence. By the
Monotone Convergence Theorem 3.3.2, the question of whether the sequence is convergent
or not is reduced to the question of whether the sequence is bounded or not. Attempts to use
direct numerical calculations to arrive at a conjecture concerning the possible boundedness
of the sequence ðhn Þ lead to inconclusive frustration. A computer run will reveal the
approximate values hn # 11:4 for n ¼ 50; 000, and hn # 12:1 for n ¼ 100;000. Such

numerical facts may lead the casual observer to conclude that the sequence is bounded.
However, the sequence is in fact divergent, which is established by noting that

Since ðhn Þ is unbounded, Theorem 3.2.2 implies that it is divergent. (This proves that
the infinite series known as the harmonic series diverges. See Example 3.7.6(b) in
Section 3.7.)
The terms hn increase extremely slowly. For example, it can be shown that to achieve
hn &gt; 50 would entail approximately 5.2 # 1021 additions, and a normal computer performing 400 million additions a second would require more than 400,000 years to perform
the calculation (there are 31,536,000 seconds in a year). A supercomputer that can perform
more than a trillion additions a second would take more than 164 years to reach that modest
goal. And the IBM Roadrunner supercomputer at a speed of a quadrillion operations per
&amp;
second would take over a year and a half.
Sequences that are defined inductively must be treated differently. If such a sequence is
known to converge, then the value of the limit can sometimes be determined by using the
inductive relation.
For example, suppose that convergence has been established for the sequence ðxn Þ
defined by
x1 ¼ 2;

xnþ1 ¼ 2 þ

;

n 2 N:

If we let x ¼ limðxn Þ, then we also have x ¼ limðxnþ1 Þ since the 1-tail ðxnþ1 Þ converges to
the same limit. Further, we see that xn # 2, so that x 6¼ 0 and xn 6¼ 0 for all n 2 N.
Therefore, we may apply the limit theorems for sequences to obtain
x ¼ limðxnþ1 Þ ¼ 2 þ

¼2þ :
limðxn Þ
x

Thus, the limit x is a solution of the quadratic equation x2 # 2x p
#ﬃﬃ1ﬃ ¼ 0, and since x must
be positive, we find that the limit of the sequence is x ¼ 1 þ 2.
Of course, the issue of convergence must not be ignored or casually assumed. For
example, if we assumed the sequence ðyn Þ defined by y1 :¼ 1; ynþ1 :¼ 2yn þ 1 is convergent with limit y, then we would obtain y ¼ 2y þ 1, so that y ¼ #1. Of course, this is
absurd.
In the following examples, we employ this method of evaluating limits, but only after
carefully establishing convergence using the Monotone Convergence Theorem. Additional
examples of this type will be given in Section 3.5.
3.3.4 Examples (a) Let Y ¼ (yn) be defined inductively by y1 :¼ 1; ynþ1 :¼ 14 ð2yn þ3Þ
for n # 1. We shall show that lim Y ¼ 3=2.

CHAPTER 3 SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Direct calculation shows that y2 ¼ 5=4. Hence we have y1 &lt; y2 &lt; 2. We show, by
Induction, that yn &lt; 2 for all n 2 N. Indeed, this is true for n ¼ 1; 2. If yk &lt; 2 holds for
some k 2 N, then
ykþ1 ¼ 14 ð2yk þ 3Þ &lt; 14 ð4 þ 3Þ ¼ 74 &lt; 2;
so that ykþ1 &lt; 2. Therefore yn &lt; 2 for all n 2 N.
We now show, by Induction, that yn &lt; ynþ1 for all n 2 N. The truth of this assertion
has been verified for n ¼ 1. Now suppose that yk &lt; ykþ1 for some k; then 2yk þ 3
&lt; 2ykþ1 þ 3, whence it follows that
ykþ1 ¼ 14 ð2yk þ 3Þ &lt; 14 ð2ykþ1 þ 3Þ ¼ ykþ2 :
Thus yk &lt; ykþ1 implies that ykþ1 &lt; ykþ2 . Therefore yn &lt; ynþ1 for all n 2 N.
We have shown that the sequence Y ¼ ðyn Þ is increasing and bounded above by 2. It
follows from the Monotone Convergence Theorem that Y converges to a limit that is at
most 2. In this case it is not so easy to evaluate limðyn Þ by calculating supfyn : n 2 Ng.
However, there is another way to evaluate its limit. Since ynþ1 ¼ 14 ð2yn þ 3Þ for all n 2 N,
the nth term in the 1-tail Y1 of Y has a simple algebraic relation to the nth term of Y. Since,
by Theorem 3.1.9, we have y :¼ lim Y 1 ¼ lim Y, it therefore follows from Theorem 3.2.3
(why?) that
y ¼ 14 ð2y þ 3Þ;
from which it follows that y ¼ 3=2.

(b) Let Z ¼ (zn) be the sequence of real numbers defined by z1 :¼ 1; znþ1 :¼ 2zn for
n 2 N. We will show that limðzpn Þﬃﬃﬃ ¼ 2.
Note that z1 ¼ 1 and z2 ¼ 2; hence 1 # z1 &lt; z2 &lt; 2. We claim that the sequence Z
is increasing and bounded above by 2. To show this we will show, by Induction, that
1 # zn &lt; znþ1 &lt; 2 for all n 2 N. This fact has been verified for n ¼ 1. Suppose that it is
true for n ¼ k; then 2 # 2zk &lt; 2zkþ1 &lt; 4, whence it follows (why?) that
1&lt;

pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃ
pﬃﬃﬃ
2 # zkþ1 ¼ 2zk &lt; zkþ2 ¼ 2zkþ1 &lt; 4 ¼ 2:

[In this last step we have used Example 2.1.13(a).] Hence the validity of the inequality
1 # zk &lt; zkþ1 &lt; 2 implies the validity of 1 # zkþ1 &lt; zkþ2 &lt; 2. Therefore 1 # zn &lt;
znþ1 &lt; 2 for all n 2 N.
Since Z ¼ ðzn Þ is a bounded increasing sequence, it follows from the Monotone
Convergence Theorem that it converges to a number z :¼ supfzn g. It may be shown
directly that supfzn g ¼ 2, sop
that
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃzﬃ ¼ 2. Alternatively we may use the method employed in
part (a). The relation znþ1 ¼ 2zn gives a relation between the nth term of the 1-tail Z1 of Z
and the nth term of Z. By Theorem 3.1.9, we have lim Z 1 ¼ z ¼ lim Z. Moreover, by
Theorems 3.2.3 and 3.2.10, it follows that the limit z must satisfy the relation
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
z ¼ 2z:
Hence z must satisfy the equation z2 ¼ 2z, which has the roots z ¼ 0; 2. Since the terms of
z ¼ ðzn Þ all satisfy 1 # zn # 2, it follows from Theorem 3.2.6 that we must have
&amp;
1 # z # 2. Therefore z ¼ 2.

The Calculation of Square Roots
We now give an application of the Monotone Convergence Theorem to the calculation of
square roots of positive numbers.
3.3.5 Example
pﬃﬃﬃ Let a &gt; 0; we will construct a sequence (sn) of real numbers that
converges to a.
Let s1 &gt; 0 be arbitrary andpdefine
snþ1 :¼ 12 ðsn þ a=sn Þ for n 2 N. We now show that
ﬃﬃﬃ
the sequence (sn) converges to a. (This process for calculating square roots was known in
Mesopotamia before 1500 B.C.)
We first show that s2n # a for n # 2. Since sn satisfies the quadratic equation
2
sn # 2snþ1 sn þ a ¼ 0, this equation has a real root. Hence the discriminant 4s2nþ1 # 4a
must be nonnegative; that is, s2nþ1 # a for n # 1.
To see that (sn) is ultimately decreasing, we note that for n # 2 we have
#
#
1
a
1 ðs2 # aÞ
sn þ
# 0:
sn # snþ1 ¼ sn #
¼ # n
2
sn
2
sn
Hence, snþ1 # sn for all n # 2. The Monotone Convergence Theorem implies that s :¼
limðsn Þ exists. Moreover, from Theorem 3.2.3, the limit s must satisfy the relation
s¼

1#
a#
sþ ;
2
s

pﬃﬃﬃ
whence it follows (why?) that s ¼ a=s or s2 ¼ a. Thus s ¼ a.
For the purposes of calculation,

the sequence (sn) converges

As

pﬃﬃﬃ
follows that a=sn # a # sn . Thus we have
pﬃﬃﬃ
0 # sn # a # sn # a=sn ¼ ðs2n # aÞ=sn for n # 2:
pﬃﬃﬃ
&amp;
Using this inequality we can calculate a to any desired degree of accuracy.

Euler’s Number
We conclude this section by introducing a sequence that converges to one of the
most important ‘‘transcendental’’ numbers in mathematics, second in importance only
to p.
3.3.6 Example Let en :¼ ð1 þ 1=nÞn for n 2 N. We will now show that the sequence E ¼
(en) is bounded and increasing; hence it is convergent. The limit of this sequence is the
famous Euler number e, whose approximate value is 2:718 281 828 459 045 . . . ; which is
taken as the base of the ‘‘natural’’ logarithm.

Note that the expression for en contains n þ 1 terms, while that for enþ1 contains n þ 2

in enþ1 , and enþ1 has one more positive term. Therefore we have 2 # e1 &lt; e2 &lt; # # # &lt;
en &lt; enþ1 &lt; # # # ; so that the terms of E are increasing.
To show that the terms of E are bounded above, we note that if p ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n, then
ð1 # p=nÞ &lt; 1. Moreover 2p#1 # p! [see 1.2.4(e)] so that 1=p! # 1=2p#1 . Therefore, if n &gt;

we deduce that 2 &lt; en &lt; 3 for all n 2 N. The Monotone Convergence Theorem implies
that the sequence E converges to a real number that is between 2 and 3. We define the
number e to be the limit of this sequence.
By refining our estimates we can find closer rational approximations to e, but we
cannot evaluate it exactly, since e is an irrational number. However, it is possible to
calculate e to as many decimal places as desired. The reader should use a calculator (or a
&amp;
computer) to evaluate en for ‘‘large’’ values of n.

Leonhard Euler
Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) was born near Basel, Switzerland. His
clergyman father hoped his son would follow him into the ministry,
but when Euler entered the University of Basel at age 14, he studied
medicine, physics, astronomy, and mathematics as well as theology. His
mathematical talent was noticed by Johann Bernoulli, who became his
mentor. In 1727, Euler traveled to Russia to join Bernoulli’s son, Daniel,
at the new St. Petersburg Academy. There he met and married Katharina
Gsell, the daughter of a Swiss artist. During their 40-year marriage, they
had 13 children, but only five survived childhood.

In 1741, Euler accepted an offer from Frederick the Great to join the Berlin Academy, where
he stayed for 25 years. During this period he wrote landmark books on a relatively new subject
called calculus and a steady stream of papers on mathematics and science. In response to a request
for instruction in science from the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau, he wrote her nearly 200 letters on
science that later became famous in a book titled Letters to a German Princess. When Euler lost
vision in one eye, Frederick thereafter referred to him as his mathematical ‘‘cyclops.’’
In 1766, he happily returned to Russia at the invitation of Catherine the Great. His eyesight
continued to deteriorate and in 1771 he became totally blind following an eye operation.
Incredibly, his blindness made little impact on his mathematics output, for he wrote several
books and over 400 papers while blind. He remained active until the day of his death.
Euler’s productivity was remarkable. He wrote textbooks on physics, algebra, calculus, real
and complex analysis, and differential geometry. He also wrote hundreds of papers, many winning
prizes. A current edition of his collected works consists of 74 volumes.

CHAPTER 3 SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Section 3.4 Subsequences and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
In this section we will introduce the notion of a subsequence of a sequence of real numbers.
Informally, a subsequence of a sequence is a selection of terms from the given sequence
such that the selected terms form a new sequence. Usually the selection is made for a
definite purpose. For example, subsequences are often useful in establishing the convergence or the divergence of the sequence. We will also prove the important existence
theorem known as the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, which will be used to establish a
number of significant results.
3.4.1 Definition Let X ¼ ðxn Þ be a sequence of real numbers and let n1 &lt; n2 &lt; # # # &lt;
nk &lt; # # # be a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers. Then the sequence X 0 ¼
ðxnk Þ given by
#
xn1 ; xn2 ; . . . ; xnk ; . . .
is called a subsequence of X.
For example, if X :¼
the subsequence

#1

1 1
1;2;3;...

X0 ¼

, then the selection of even indexed terms produces

#

1 1 1
1
; ; ;...; ;... ;
2 4 6
2k

where n1 ¼ 2; n2 ¼ 4; . . . ; nk ¼ 2k; : . . . Other subsequences of X ¼ ð1=nÞ are the
following:

A tail of a sequence (see 3.1.8) is a special type of subsequence. In fact, the m-tail
corresponds to the sequence of indices
n1 ¼ m þ 1; n2 ¼ m þ 2; . . . ; nk ¼ m þ k; . . . :
But, clearly, not every subsequence of a given sequence need be a tail of the sequence.
Subsequences of convergent sequences also converge to the same limit, as we now show.
3.4.2 Theorem If a sequence X ¼ ðxn Þ of real numbers converges to a real number x,
then any subsequence X 0 ¼ ðxnk Þ of X also converges to x.
Proof. Let e &gt; 0 be given and let KðeÞ be such that if n # KðeÞ, then jxn # xj &lt; e. Since
n1 &lt; n2 &lt; # # # &lt; nk &lt; # # # is an increasing sequence of natural numbers, it is easily proved
(by Induction) that nk # k. Hence, if k # KðeÞ, we also have nk # k # KðeÞ so that
jxnk # xj &lt; e. Therefore the subsequence ðxnk Þ also converges to x.
Q.E.D.
3.4.3 Examples (a) limðbn Þ ¼ 0 if 0 &lt; b &lt; 1.
We have already seen, in Example 3.1.11(b), that if 0 &lt; b &lt; 1 and if xn :¼ bn , then it
follows from Bernoulli’s Inequality that limðxn Þ ¼ 0. Alternatively, we see that since

0 &lt; b &lt; 1, then xnþ1 ¼ bnþ1 &lt; bn ¼ xn so that the sequence ðxn Þ is decreasing. It is also
clear that 0 # xn # 1, so it follows from the Monotone Convergence Theorem 3.3.2 that
the sequence is convergent. Let x :¼ lim xn . Since ðx2n Þ is a subsequence of ðxn Þ it follows
from Theorem 3.4.2 that x ¼ limðx2n Þ. Moreover, it follows from the relation x2n ¼ b2n ¼
ðbn Þ2 ¼ x2n and Theorem 3.2.3 that
#
2
x ¼ limðx2n Þ ¼ limðxn Þ ¼ x2 :
Therefore we must have either x ¼ 0 or x ¼ 1. Since the sequence ðxn Þ is decreasing and
bounded above by b &lt; 1, we deduce that x ¼ 0.
(b) limðc1=n Þ ¼ 1 for c &gt; 1.
This limit has been obtained in Example 3.1.11(c) for c &gt; 0, using a rather ingenious
argument. We give here an alternative approach for the case c &gt; 1. Note that if zn :¼ c1=n ;
then zn &gt; 1 and znþ1 &lt; zn for all n 2 N. (Why?) Thus by the Monotone Convergence
Theorem, the limit z :¼ limðzn Þ exists. By Theorem 3.4.2, it follows that z ¼ limðz2n Þ. In
addition, it follows from the relation
z2n ¼ c1=2n ¼ ðc1=n Þ1=2 ¼ z1=2
n
and Theorem 3.2.10 that
#
z ¼ limðz2n Þ ¼ limðzn Þ

1=2

¼ z1=2 :

Therefore we have z2 ¼ z whence it follows that either z ¼ 0 or z ¼ 1. Since zn &gt; 1 for all
n 2 N, we deduce that z ¼ 1.
&amp;
We leave it as an exercise to the reader to consider the case 0 &lt; c &lt; 1.
The following result is based on a careful negation of the definition of limðxn Þ ¼ x. It
leads to a convenient way to establish the divergence of a sequence.
3.4.4 Theorem Let X ¼ ðxn Þ be a sequence of real numbers, Then the following are
equivalent:
(i) The sequence X ¼ ðxn Þ does not converge to x 2 R.
(ii) There exists an e0 &gt; 0 such that for any k 2 N, there exists nk 2 N such that
nk # k and jxnk # xj # e0 .
(iii) There exists an e0 &gt; 0 and a subsequence X 0 ¼ ðxnk Þ of X such that jxnk # xj # e0 for
all k 2 N.
Proof. ðiÞ ) ðiiÞ If ðxn Þ does not converge to x, then for some e0 &gt; 0 it is impossible to
find a natural number k such that for all n # k the terms xn satisfy jxn # xj &lt; e0. That is, for
each k 2 N it is not true that for all n # k the inequality jxn # xj &lt; e0 holds. In other
words, for each k 2 N there exists a natural number nk # k such that jxnk # xj # e0 .
ðiiÞ ) ðiiiÞ Let e0 be as in (ii) and let n1 2 N be such that n1 # 1 and jxn1 # xj # e0 .
Now let n2 2 N be such that n2 &gt; n1 and jxn2 # xj # e0 ; let n3 2 N be such that
n3 &gt; n2 and jxn3 # xj # e0 . Continue in this way to obtain a subsequence X 0 ¼ ðxnk Þ of
X such that jxnk # xj # e0 for all k 2 N.
ðiiiÞ ) ðiÞ Suppose X ¼ ðxn Þ has a subsequence X 0 ¼ ðxnk Þ satisfying the condition
in (iii). Then X cannot converge to x; for if it did, then, by Theorem 3.4.2, the subsequence
X0 would also converge to x. But this is impossible, since none of the terms of X0 belongs to
the e0-neighborhood of x.

CHAPTER 3 SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Since all subsequences of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we
have part (i) in the following result. Part (ii) follows from the fact that a convergent
sequence is bounded.
3.4.5 Divergence Criteria If a sequence X ¼ ðxn Þ of real numbers has either of the
following properties, then X is divergent.
(i) X has two convergent subsequences X 0 ¼ ðxnk Þ and X 00 ¼ ðxrk Þ whose limits are not
equal.
(ii) X is unbounded.
3.4.6 Examples (a) The sequence X :¼ ðð#1Þn Þ is divergent.
The subsequence X 0 :¼ ðð#1Þ2n Þ ¼ ð1; 1; . . .Þ converges to 1, and the subsequence
00
X :¼ ðð#1Þ2n#1 Þ ¼ ð#1; #1; . . .Þ converges to #1. Therefore, we conclude from Theorem 3.4.5(i) that X is divergent.
#
(b) The sequence 1; 12 ; 3; 14 ; . . . is divergent.
This is the sequence Y ¼ ðyn Þ, where yn ¼ n if n is odd, and yn ¼ 1=n if n is even. It
can easily be seen that Y is not bounded. Hence, by Theorem 3.4.5(ii), the sequence is
divergent.
(c) The sequence S :¼ (sin n) is divergent.
This sequence is not so easy to handle. In discussing it we must, of course, make use of
elementary properties of the sine function. We recall that sinðp=6Þ ¼ 12 ¼ sinð5p=6Þ and
that sin x &gt; 12 for x in the interval I 1 :¼ ðp=6; 5p=6Þ. Since the length of I 1 is
5p=6 # p=6 ¼ 2p=3 &gt; 2, there are at least two natural numbers lying inside I 1 ; we let
n1 be the first such number. Similarly, for each k 2 N, sin x &gt; 12 for x in the interval
#
I k :¼ p=6 þ 2pðk # 1Þ; 5p=6 þ 2pðk # 1Þ :
Since the length of Ik is greater than 2, there are at least two natural numbers lying inside Ik;
we let nk be the first one. The subsequence S0 :¼ ðsin nk Þ of S obtained in this way has the
property that all of its values lie in the interval 12 ; 1 .
Similarly, if k 2 N and Jk is the interval
#
J k :¼ 7p=6 þ 2pðk # 1Þ; 11p=6 þ 2pðk # 1Þ ;
then it is seen that sin x &lt; # 12 for all x 2 J k and the length of J k is greater than 2. Let mk be
the first natural number lying in Jk. Then the subsequence S 00 :¼ ðsin mk Þ of S has the
property that all of its values lie in the interval #1; # 12 .
Given any real number c, it is readily seen that at least one of the subsequences S0 and
00
S lies entirely outside of the 12-neighborhood of c. Therefore c cannot be a limit of S. Since
&amp;
c 2 R is arbitrary, we deduce that S is divergent.
The Existence of Monotone Subsequences
While not every sequence is a monotone sequence, we will now show that every sequence
has a monotone subsequence.
3.4.7 Monotone Subsequence Theorem If X ¼ ðxn Þ is a sequence of real numbers,
then there is a subsequence of X that is monotone.
Proof. For the purpose of this proof, we will say that the mth term xm is a ‘‘peak’’ if
xm # xn for all n such that n # m. (That is, xm is never exceeded by any term that follows it

in the sequence.) Note that, in a decreasing sequence, every term is a peak, while in an
increasing sequence, no term is a peak.
We will consider two cases, depending on whether X has infinitely many, or finitely
many, peaks.
Case 1: X has infinitely many peaks. In this case, we list the peaks by increasing
subscripts: xm1 ; xm2 ; . . . ; xmk ; : . . . Since each term is a peak, we have
xm1 # xm2 # # # # # xmk # # # # :
Therefore, the subsequence ðxmk Þ of peaks is a decreasing subsequence of X.
Case 2: X has a finite number (possibly zero) of peaks. Let these peaks be listed by
increasing subscripts: xm1 ; xm2 ; . . . ; xmr . Let s1 :¼ mr þ 1 be the first index beyond the last
peak. Since xs1 is not a peak, there exists s2 &gt; s1 such that xs1 &lt; xs2 . Since xs2 is not a peak,
there exists s3 &gt; s2 such that xs2 &lt; xs3 . Continuing in this way, we obtain an increasing
subsequence ðxsk Þ of X.
Q.E.D.
It is not difficult to see that a given sequence may have one subsequence that is
increasing, and another subsequence that is decreasing.
The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
We will now use the Monotone Subsequence Theorem to prove the Bolzano-Weierstrass
Theorem, which states that every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.
Because of the importance of this theorem we will also give a second proof of it based
on the Nested Interval Property.
3.4.8 The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem A bounded sequence of real numbers has a
convergent subsequence.
First Proof. It follows from the Monotone Subsequence Theorem that if X ¼ ðxn Þ is a
bounded sequence, then it has a subsequence X 0 ¼ ðxnk Þ that is monotone. Since this
subsequence is also bounded, it follows from the Monotone Convergence Theorem 3.3.2
that the subsequence is convergent.
Q.E.D.
Second Proof. Since the set of values fxn : n 2 Ng is bounded, this set is contained in an
interval I 1 :¼ ½a; b . We take n1 :¼ 1.
We now bisect I1 into two equal subintervals I10 and I 100, and divide the set of indices
fn 2 N : n &gt; 1g into two parts:
A1 :¼ fn 2 N : n &gt; n1 ; xn 2 I10 g;

B1 ¼ fn 2 N : n &gt; n1 ; xn 2 I 100g:

If A1 is infinite, we take I 2 :¼ I10 and let n2 be the smallest natural number in A1. If A1 is a
finite set, then Bl must be infinite, and we take I 2 :¼ I 100 and let n2 be the smallest natural
number in B1.
We now bisect I2 into two equal subintervals I20 and I 200, and divide the set
fn 2 N : n &gt; n2 g into two parts:
A2 ¼ fn 2 N : n &gt; n2 ; xn ; 2 I20 g;

B2 :¼ fn 2 N : n &gt; n2 ; xn 2 I 200g

If A2 is infinite, we take I 3 :¼ I20 and let n3 be the smallest natural number in A2. If A2 is a
finite set, then B2 must be infinite, and we take I 3 :¼ I 200 and let n3 be the smallest natural
number in B2.

We continue in this way to obtain a sequence of nested intervals I 1 I 2 # # #
I k # # # and a subsequence ðxnk Þ of X such that xnk 2 I k for k 2 N. Since the length of I k is
equal to ðb # aÞ=2k#1 , it follows from Theorem 2.5.3 that there is a (unique) common point
j 2 I k for all k 2 N. Moreover, since xnk and j both belong to Ik, we have
jxnk # jj # ðb # aÞ=2k#1 ;
whence it follows that the subsequence ðxnk Þ of X converges to j.

Q.E.D.

Theorem 3.4.8 is sometimes called the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem for sequences,
because there is another version of it that deals with bounded sets in R (see Exercise 11.2.6).
It is readily seen that a bounded sequence can have various subsequences that converge
to different limits or even diverge. For example, the sequence ðð#1Þn Þ has subsequences
that converge to #1, other subsequences that converge to þ1, and it has subsequences that
diverge.
Let X be a sequence of real numbers and let X0 be a subsequence of X. Then X0 is a
sequence in its own right, and so it has subsequences. We note that if X 00 is a subsequence of
X0 , then it is also a subsequence of X.
3.4.9 Theorem Let X ¼ ðxn Þ be a bounded sequence of real numbers and let x 2 R have
the property that every convergent subsequence of X converges to x. Then the sequence X
converges to x.
Proof. Suppose M &gt; 0 is a bound for the sequence X so that jxn j # M for all n 2 N. If X
does not converge to x, then Theorem 3.4.4 implies that there exist e0 &gt; 0 and a
subsequence X 0 ¼ ðxnk Þ of X such that
ð1Þ

jxnk # xj # e0

for all

k 2 N:

Since X 0 is a subsequence of X, the number M is also a bound for X 0. Hence the BolzanoWeierstrass Theorem implies that X 0 has a convergent subsequence X 00 . Since X 00 is also a
subsequence of X, it converges to x by hypothesis. Thus, its terms ultimately belong to the
e0-neighborhood of x, contradicting (1).
Q.E.D.

Limit Superior and Limit Inferior
A bounded sequence of real numbers ðxn Þ may or may not converge, but we know from the
Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 3.4.8 that there will be a convergent subsequence and possibly
many convergent subsequences. A real number that is the limit of a subsequence of ðxn Þ
is called a subsequential limit of ðxn Þ. We let S denote the set of all subsequential limits of
the bounded sequence ðxn Þ. The set S is bounded, because the sequence is bounded.
For example, if ðxn Þ is defined by xn :¼ ð#1Þn þ 2=n, then the subsequence ðx2n Þ
converges to 1, and the subsequence ðx2n#1 Þ converges to #1. It is easily seen that the set of
subsequential limits is S ¼ f#1; 1g. Observe that the largest member of the sequence itself
is x2 ¼ 2, which provides no information concerning the limiting behavior of the sequence.
An extreme example is given by the set of all rational numbers in the interval [0, 1].
The set is denumerable (see Section 1.3) and therefore it can be written as a sequence ðrn Þ.
Then it follows from the Density Theorem 2.4.8 that every number in [0, 1] is a
subsequential limit of ðrn Þ. Thus we have S ¼ ½0; 1 .
A bounded sequence ðxn Þ that diverges will display some form of oscillation. The
activity is contained in decreasing intervals as follows. The interval ½t1 ; u1 , where t1 :¼

inf fxn : n 2 Ng and u1 :¼ supfxn : n 2 Ng, contains the entire sequence. If for each
m ¼ 1; 2; . . ., we define tm :¼ inffxn : n # mg and um :¼ supfxn : n # mg, the sequences
ðtm Þ and ðum Þ are monotone and we obtain a nested sequence of intervals ½tm ; um where the
mth interval contains the m-tail of the sequence.
The preceding discussion suggests different ways of describing limiting behavior of a
bounded sequence. Another is to observe that if a real number v has the property that xn &gt; v
for at most a finite number of values of n, then no subsequence of ðxn Þ can converge to a
limit larger than v because that would require infinitely many terms of the sequence be
larger than v. In other words, if v has the property that there exists Nv such that xn # v for all
n # N v , then no number larger than v can be a subsequential limit of ðxn Þ.
This observation leads to the following definition of limit superior. The accompanying
definition of limit inferior is similar.
3.4.10 Definition Let X ¼ ðxn Þ be a bounded sequence of real numbers.
(a) The limit superior of ðxn Þ is the infimum of the set V of v 2 R such that v &lt; xn for at
most a finite number of n 2 N. It is denoted by
lim supðxn Þ or

lim sup X

or limðxn Þ:

(b) The limit inferior of ðxn Þ is the supremum of the set of w 2 R such that xm &lt; w for at
most a finite number of m 2 N. It is denoted by
lim infðxn Þ or

lim inf X

or limðxn Þ:

For the concept of limit superior, we now show that the different approaches are equivalent.
3.4.11 Theorem If ðxn Þ is a bounded sequence of real numbers, then the following
statements for a real number x# are equivalent.
(a) x# ¼ lim supðxn Þ:
(b) If e &gt; 0, there are at most a finite number of n 2 N such that x# þ e &lt; xn , but an
infinite number of n 2 N such that x# # e &lt; xn .
(c) If um ¼ supfxn : n # mg; then x# ¼ inffum : m 2 Ng ¼ limðum Þ.
(d) If S is the set of subsequential limits of ðxn Þ, then x# ¼ sup S.
Proof. (a) implies (b). If e &gt; 0, then the fact that x# is an infimum implies that there
exists a v in V such that x# # v &lt; x# þ e. Therefore x# also belongs to V, so there can be at
most a finite number of n 2 N such that x# þ e &lt; xn . On the other hand, x# # e is not in V
so there are an infinite number of n 2 N such that x# # e &lt; xn .
(b) implies (c). If (b) holds, given e &gt; 0, then for all sufficiently large m we have
um &lt; x þ e. Therefore, inffum : m 2 Ng # x# þ e. Also, since there are an infinite number
of n 2 N such that x# # e &lt; xn , then x# # e &lt; um for all m 2 N and hence x# # e #
inffum : m 2 Ng. Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that x# ¼ inffum : m 2 Ng.
Moreover, since the sequence ðum Þ is monotone decreasing, we have infðum Þ ¼ limðum Þ.
(c) implies (d). Suppose that X 0 ¼ ðxnk Þ is a convergent subsequence of X ¼ ðxn Þ:
Since nk # k, we have xnk # uk and hence lim X 0 # limðuk Þ ¼ x# : Conversely, there exists
n1 such that u1 # 1 # xn1 # u1 . Inductively choose nkþ1 &gt; nk such that
uk #

1
&lt; xnkþ1 # uk :
kþ1

Since lim ðuk Þ ¼ x# , it follows that x# ¼ limðxnk Þ, and hence x# 2 S.

(d) implies (a). Let w ¼ sup S. If e &gt; 0 is given, then there are at most finitely many n
with w þ e &lt; xn . Therefore w þ e belongs to V and lim sup ðxn Þ # w þ e. On the other
hand, there exists a subsequence of ðxn Þ converging to some number larger than w # e, so
that w # e is not in V, and hence w # e # lim sup ðxn Þ. Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we
conclude that w ¼ lim sup ðxn Þ.

As an instructive exercise, the reader should formulate the corresponding theorem for
the limit inferior of a bounded sequence of real numbers.

Section 3.5 The Cauchy Criterion
The Monotone Convergence Theorem is extraordinarily useful and important, but it has the
significant drawback that it applies only to sequences that are monotone. It is important for
us to have a condition implying the convergence of a sequence that does not require us to
know the value of the limit in advance, and is not restricted to monotone sequences. The
Cauchy Criterion, which will be established in this section, is such a condition.
3.5.1 Definition A sequence X ¼ ðxn Þ of real numbers is said to be a Cauchy sequence
if for every e &gt; 0 there exists a natural number HðeÞ such that for all natural numbers
n; m # HðeÞ, the terms xn ; xm satisfy jxn # xm j &lt; e.
The significance of the concept of Cauchy sequence lies in the main theorem of this
section, which asserts that a sequence of real numbers is convergent if and only if it is a
Cauchy sequence. This will give us a method of proving a sequence converges without
knowing the limit of the sequence.
However, we will first highlight the definition of Cauchy sequence in the following
examples.
3.5.2 Examples (a) The sequence (1=n) is a Cauchy sequence.
If e &gt; 0 is given, we choose a natural number H ¼ H(e) such that H &gt; 2=e. Then if
m; n # H, we have 1=n # 1=H &lt; e=2 and similarly 1=m &lt; e=2. Therefore, it follows that
if m; n # H, then
#
#
#1 1 # 1 1
# # # # þ &lt; e þ e ¼ e:
#n m# n m 2 2
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that (1=n) is a Cauchy sequence.
(b) The sequence (1 þ (#1)n) is not a Cauchy sequence.
The negation of the definition of Cauchy sequence is: There exists e0 &gt; 0 such that for
every H there exist at least one n &gt; H and at least one m &gt; H such that jxn # xm j # e0 . For

the terms xn :¼ 1 þ ð#1Þn , we observe that if n is even, then xn ¼ 2 and xnþ1 ¼ 0. If we
take e0 ¼ 2, then for any H we can choose an even number n &gt; H and let m :¼ n þ 1 to get
jxn # xnþ1 j ¼ 2 ¼ e0 :
We conclude that (xn) is not a Cauchy sequence.

&amp;

Remark We emphasize that to prove a sequence ðxn Þ is a Cauchy sequence, we may not
assume a relationship between m and n, since the required inequality jxn # xm j &lt; e must
hold for all n; m # HðeÞ. But to prove a sequence is not a Cauchy sequence, we may specify
a relation between n and m as long as arbitrarily large values of n and m can be chosen so
that jxn # xm j # e0 .
Our goal is to show that the Cauchy sequences are precisely the convergent sequences.
We first prove that a convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence.
3.5.3 Lemma If X ¼ ðxn Þ is a convergent sequence of real numbers, then X is a Cauchy
sequence.
Proof. If x :¼ lim X, then given e &gt; 0 there is a natural number Kðe=2Þ such that if
n # Kðe=2Þ then jxn # xj &lt; e=2. Thus, if HðeÞ :¼ Kðe=2Þ and if n; m # HðeÞ, then we
have
jxn # xm j ¼ jðxn # xÞ þ ðx # xm Þj
# jxn # xj þ jxm # xj &lt; e=2 þ e=2 ¼ e:
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, it follows that (xn) is a Cauchy sequence.

Q.E.D.

In order to establish that a Cauchy sequence is convergent, we will need the following
result. (See Theorem 3.2.2.)
3.5.4 Lemma A Cauchy sequence of real numbers is bounded.
Proof. Let X :¼ ðxn Þ be a Cauchy sequence and let e :¼ 1. If H :¼ Hð1Þ and n # H,
then jxn # xH j &lt; 1. Hence, by the Triangle Inequality, we have jxn j # jxH j þ 1 for all
n # H. If we set
M :¼ supfjx1 j; jx2 j; . . . ; jxH#1 j; jxH j þ 1g;
then it follows that jxn j # M for all n 2 N.

Q.E.D.

We now present the important Cauchy Convergence Criterion.
3.5.5 Cauchy Convergence Criterion A sequence of real numbers is convergent if and
only if it is a Cauchy sequence.
Proof. We have seen, in Lemma 3.5.3, that a convergent sequence is a Cauchy
sequence.
Conversely, let X ¼ ðxn Þ be a Cauchy sequence; we will show that X is convergent to
some real number. First we observe from Lemma 3.5.4 that the sequence X is bounded.
Therefore, by the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 3.4.8, there is a subsequence X 0 ¼ ðxnk Þ
of X that converges to some real number x#. We shall complete the proof by showing that X
converges to x#.

averaging, it is readily seen that

n 2 N:

Therefore, given e &gt; 0, if n is chosen so large that 1=2n &lt; e=4 and if m # n, then it follows
that jxn # xm j &lt; e. Therefore, X is a Cauchy sequence in R. By the Cauchy Criterion 3.5.5
we infer that the sequence X converges to a number x.
To evaluate the limit x, we might first ‘‘pass to the limit’’ in the rule of definition
xn ¼ 12 ðxn#1 þ xn#2 Þ to conclude that x must satisfy the relation x ¼ 12 ðx þ xÞ, which is
true, but not informative. Hence we must try something else.

Since 0 &lt; C &lt; 1, we know limðC n Þ ¼ 0 [see 3.1.11(b)]. Therefore, we infer that (xn) is a
Cauchy sequence. It now follows from the Cauchy Convergence Criterion 3.5.5 that (xn) is
Q.E.D.
a convergent sequence.
3.5.9 Example We consider the sequence of Fibonacci fractions xn :¼ f n =f nþ1 where
f 1 ¼ f 2 ¼ 1 and f nþ1 ¼ f n þ f n#1 . (See Example 3.1.2(d).) The first few terms are
x1 ¼ 1; x2 ¼ 1=2; x3 ¼ 2=3; x4 ¼ 3=5; x5 ¼ 5=8, and so on. It is shown that the sequence ðxn Þ is given inductively by the equation xnþ1 ¼ 1=ð1 þ xn Þ as follows:
xnþ1 ¼

f nþ1
f nþ1
1
1
¼
¼
¼
:
1 þ xn
f nþ2 f nþ1 þ f n 1 þ f n
f
nþ1

An induction argument establishes 1=2 # xn # 1 for all n, so that adding 1 and taking
reciprocals gives us the inequality 1=2 # 1=ð1 þ xn Þ # 2=3 for all n. It then follows that
jxnþ1 # xn j ¼

jxn # xn#1 j
2 2
4
# # jxn # xn#1 j ¼ jxn # xn#1 j:
ð1 þ xn Þð1 þ xn#1 Þ 3 3

Hence, the sequence (xn) is contractive and therefore converges by Theorem 3.5.8. Passing
to the limit x ¼ limðxn Þ, we obtain the equation x ¼ 1=ð1 þ xÞ, so that x satisfies the
2
equation xp
þ
ﬃﬃﬃ x # 1 ¼ 0. The quadratic formula gives us the positive solution
x ¼ ð#1 þ 5Þ=2 ¼ 0:618034:p. ﬃﬃ.ﬃ.
The reciprocal 1=x ¼ ð1 þ 5Þ=2 ¼ 1:618034 . . . is often denoted by the Greek letter w
and referred to as the Golden Ratio in the history of geometry. In the artistic theory of the ancient
Greek philosophers, a rectangle having w as the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is the
rectangle most pleasing to the eye. The number also has many interesting mathematical
&amp;
properties. (A historical discussion of the Golden Ratio can be found on Wikipedia.)
In the process of calculating the limit of a contractive sequence, it is often very
important to have an estimate of the error at the nth stage. In the next result we give two

such estimates: the first one involves the first two terms in the sequence and n; the second
one involves the difference xn # xn#1 .

Q.E.D.

3.5.11 Example We are told that the cubic equation x3 # 7x þ 2 ¼ 0 has a solution
between 0 and 1 and we wish to approximate this solution. This can be accomplished by
means of an iteration procedure as follows. We first rewrite the equation as x ¼ ðx3 þ 2Þ=7
and use this to define a sequence. We assign to x1 an arbitrary value between 0 and 1, and then
define
xnþ1 :¼ 17 ðx3n þ 2Þ

for

n 2 N:

Because 0 &lt; x1 &lt; 1, it follows that 0 &lt; xn &lt; 1 for all n 2 N. (Why?) Moreover, we
have

#
#
##
#
#
#
¼ 17#x2nþ1 þ xnþ1 xn þ x2n ##xnþ1 # xn # # 37#xnþ1 # xn #:
Therefore, (xn) is a contractive sequence and hence there exists r such that limðxn Þ ¼ r. If
we pass to the limit on both sides of the equality xnþ1 ¼ ðx3n þ 2Þ=7, we obtain r ¼
ðr3 þ 2Þ=7 and hence r3 # 7r þ 2 ¼ 0. Thus r is a solution of the equation.
We can approximate r by choosing x1, and calculating x2 ; x3 ; . . . successively. For
example, if we take x1 ¼ 0:5, we obtain (to nine decimal places):
x2 ¼ 0:303 571 429;

x3 ¼ 0:289 710 830;

x4 ¼ 0:289 188 016;

x5 ¼ 0:289 169 244;

x6 ¼ 0:289 168 571;

etc:

To estimate the accuracy, we note that jx2 # x1 j &lt; 0:2. Thus, after n steps it follows from
Corollary 3.5.10(i) that we are sure that jx# # xn j # 3n#1 ð7n#2 # 20Þ. Thus, when n ¼ 6, we
are sure that
jx# # x6 j # 35 =ð74 # 20Þ ¼ 243=48 020 &lt; 0:0051:
Actually the approximation is substantially better than this. In fact, since jx6 # x5 j &lt;
0:000 0005, it follows from 3.5.10(ii) that jx# # x6 j # 34 jx6 # x5 j &lt; 0:000 0004. Hence the
&amp;
first five decimal places of x6 are correct.

Section 3.6 Properly Divergent Sequences
For certain purposes it is convenient to define what is meant for a sequence ðxn Þ of real
numbers to ‘‘tend to 1.’’

CHAPTER 3 SEQUENCES AND SERIES

3.6.1 Definition Let ðxn Þ be a sequence of real numbers.
(i) We say that ðxn Þ tends to 1, and write limðxn Þ ¼ þ1, if for every a 2 R there
exists a natural number KðaÞ such that if n # KðaÞ, then xn &gt; a.
(ii) We say that (xn) tends to #1, and write limðxn Þ ¼ #1, if for every b 2 R there
exists a natural number K(b) such that if n # KðbÞ, then xn &lt; b.
We say that ðxn Þ is properly divergent in case we have either limðxn Þ ¼ þ1 or
limðxn Þ ¼ #1.
The reader should realize that we are using the symbols þ1 and #1 purely as a
convenient notation in the above expressions. Results that have been proved in earlier
sections for conventional limits limðxn Þ ¼ L ðfor L 2 RÞ may not remain true when
limðxn Þ ¼ 1.
3.6.2 Examples (a) limðnÞ ¼ þ1.
In fact, if a 2 R is given, let K(a) be any natural number such that K(a) &gt; a.
(b) limðn2 Þ ¼ þ1.
If K(a) is a natural number such that K(a) &gt; a, and if n # KðaÞ then we have
n2 # n &gt; a.
(c) If c &gt; 1, then limðcn Þ ¼ þ1.
Let c ¼ 1 þ b, where b &gt; 0. If a 2 R is given, let K(a) be a natural number such that
KðaÞ &gt; a=b. If n # KðaÞ it follows from Bernoulli’s Inequality that
cn ¼ ð1 þ bÞn # 1 þ nb &gt; 1 þ a &gt; a:
&amp;

Therefore limðcn Þ ¼ þ1.

Monotone sequences are particularly simple in regard to their convergence. We have
seen in the Monotone Convergence Theorem 3.3.2 that a monotone sequence is convergent
if and only if it is bounded. The next result is a reformulation of that result.
3.6.3 Theorem A monotone sequence of real numbers is properly divergent if and only if
it is unbounded.
(a) If ðxn Þ is an unbounded increasing sequence, then limðxn Þ ¼ þ1.
(b) If ðxn Þ is an unbounded decreasing sequence, then limðxn Þ ¼ #1.
Proof. (a) Suppose that (xn) is an increasing sequence. We know that if (xn) is bounded,
then it is convergent. If (xn) is unbounded, then for any a 2 R there exists nðaÞ 2 N such
that a &lt; xnðaÞ . But since (xn) is increasing, we have a &lt; xn for all n # nðaÞ. Since a is
arbitrary, it follows that limðxn Þ ¼ þ1.
Part (b) is proved in a similar fashion.
Q.E.D.
The following ‘‘comparison theorem’’ is frequently used in showing that a sequence is
properly divergent. [In fact, we implicitly used it in Example 3.6.2(c).]
3.6.4 Theorem Let (xn) and (yn) be two sequences of real numbers and suppose that

3.6 PROPERLY DIVERGENT SEQUENCES

93

Proof. (a) If limðxn Þ ¼ þ1, and if a 2 R is given, then there exists a natural number
K(a) such that if n # KðaÞ, then a &lt; xn . In view of (1), it follows that a &lt; yn for all
n # KðaÞ. Since a is arbitrary, it follows that limðyn Þ ¼ þ1.
The proof of (b) is similar.
Q.E.D.
Remarks (a) Theorem 3.6.4 remains true if condition (1) is ultimately true; that is, if
there exists m 2 N such that xn # yn for all n # m.
(b) If condition (1) of Theorem 3.6.4 holds and if limðyn Þ ¼ þ1, it does not follow that
limðxn Þ ¼ þ1. Similarly, if (1) holds and if limðxn Þ ¼ #1, it does not follow that
limðyn Þ ¼ #1. In using Theorem 3.6.4 to show that a sequence tends to þ1 [respectively,
#1] we need to show that the terms of the sequence are ultimately greater [respectively,
less] than or equal to the corresponding terms of a sequence that is known to tend to þ1
[respectively, #1].
Since it is sometimes difficult to establish an inequality such as (1), the following
‘‘limit comparison theorem’’ is often more convenient to use than Theorem 3.6.4.
3.6.5 Theorem Let (xn) and (yn) be two sequences of positive real numbers and suppose
that for some L 2 R; L &gt; 0, we have
limðxn =yn Þ ¼ L:

(2)

Then limðxn Þ ¼ þ1 if and only if limðyn Þ ¼ þ1.
Proof. If (2) holds, there exists K 2 N such that
1
2L

&lt; xn =yn &lt; 32 L for all n # K:
#
#
Hence we have 12 L yn &lt; xn &lt; 32 L yn for all n # K. The conclusion now follows from a
slight modification of Theorem 3.6.4. We leave the details to the reader.
Q.E.D.
The reader can show that the conclusion need not hold if either L ¼ 0 or L ¼ þ1.
However, there are some partial results that can be established in these cases, as will be
seen in the exercises.

Section 3.7 Introduction to Infinite Series
We will now give a brief introduction to infinite series of real numbers. This is a topic that
will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9, but because of its importance, we will
establish a few results here. These results will be seen to be immediate consequences of
theorems we have met in this chapter.
In elementary texts, an infinite series is sometimes ‘‘defined’’ to be ‘‘an expression of
the form’’
(1)

x 1 þ x 2 þ # # # þ xn þ # # # :

However, this ‘‘definition’’ lacks clarity, since there is a priori no particular value that we
can attach to this array of symbols, which calls for an infinite number of additions to be
performed.
3.7.1 Definition If X :¼ (xn) is a sequence in R, then the infinite series (or simply the
series) generated by X is the sequence S :¼ (sk) defined by
s1 :¼ x1
s2 :¼ s1 þ x2 ð¼ x1 þ x2 Þ
###
sk :¼ sk#1 þ xk ð¼ x1 þ x2 þ # # # þ xk Þ
###
The numbers xn are called the terms of the series and the numbers sk are called the partial
sums of this series. If lim S exists, we say that this series is convergent and call this limit
the sum or the value of this series. If this limit does not exist, we say that the series S is
divergent.
It is convenient to use symbols such as
X
X
ðxn Þ or
xn
(2)

or

1
X

xn

n¼1

to denote both the infinite series S generated by the sequence X ¼ (xn) and also to denote
the value lim S, in case this limit exists. Thus the symbols in (2) may be regarded merely
as a way of exhibiting an infinite series whose convergence or divergence is to be
investigated. In practice, this double use of these notations does not lead to any confusion,
provided it is understood that the convergence (or divergence) of the series must be
established.

3.7 INTRODUCTION TO INFINITE SERIES

Just as a sequence may be indexed such that its first element is not x1, but is x0, or x5 or

X

xn

or

n¼5

n¼99

It should be noted that when the first term in the series is xN, then the first partial sum is
denoted by sN.
Warning The reader should guard against confusing the words ‘‘sequence’’ and ‘‘series.’’
In nonmathematical language, these words are interchangeable; however, in mathematics,
these words are not synonyms. Indeed, a series is a sequence S ¼ (sk) obtained from a given
sequence X ¼ (xn) according to the special procedure given in Definition 3.7.1.
3.7.2 Examples (a) Consider the sequence X :¼ ðrn Þ1
n¼0 where r 2 R, which generates
the geometric series:
1
X

(3)

rn ¼ 1 þ r þ r2 þ # # # þ rn þ # # # :

n¼0

We will show that if jrj &lt; 1, then this series converges to 1=ð1 # rÞ. (See also
Example 1.2.4(f).) Indeed, if sn :¼ 1 þ r þ r2 þ # # # þ rn for n # 0, and if we multiply sn
by r and subtract the result from sn, we obtain (after some simplification):
sn ð1 # rÞ ¼ 1 # rnþ1 :
Therefore, we have
sn #

rnþ1
¼

1#r 1#r

from which it follows that
#
#
nþ1
#
#
#sn # 1 # # jrj
:
#
#
1#r
j1 # rj
Since jrjnþ1 ! 0 when jrj &lt; 1, it follows that the geometric series converges to 1=ð1 # rÞ
when jrj &lt; 1.

(b) Consider the series generated by ð#1Þn n¼0 ; that is, the series:
(4)

1
X

ð#1Þn ¼ ðþ1Þ þ ð#1Þ þ ðþ1Þ þ ð#1Þ þ # # # :

n¼0

It is easily seen (by Mathematical Induction) that sn ¼ 1 if n # 0 is even and sn ¼ 0 if
n is odd; therefore, the sequence of partial sums is ð1; 0; 1; 0; . . .Þ. Since this sequence is
not convergent, the series (4) is divergent.

We now present a very useful and simple necessary condition for the convergence of a
series. It is far from being sufficient, however.
3.7.3 The nth Term Test If the series

xn converges, then limðxn Þ ¼ 0.

xn ¼ sn # sn#1 , then limðxn Þ ¼ limðsn Þ # limðsn#1 Þ ¼ 0.

Since the following Cauchy Criterion is precisely a reformulation of Theorem 3.5.5,
we will omit its proof.

3.7.5 Theorem Let (xn) be a sequence of nonnegative real numbers. Then the series xn
converges if and only if the sequence S ¼ ðsk Þ of partial sums is bounded. In this case,

xn ¼ limðsk Þ ¼ supfsk : k 2 Ng:

Proof. Since xn # 0, the sequence S of partial sums is monotone increasing:
s1 # s2 # # # # # sk # # # # :
By the Monotone Convergence Theorem 3.3.2, the sequence S ¼ ðsk Þ converges if and
only if it is bounded, in which case its limit equals supfsk g.

Since the terms 1=n ! 0, we cannot use the nth Term Test 3.7.3 to establish this
divergence. However, it was seen in Examples 3.3.3(b) and 3.5.6(c) that the sequence (sn)
of partial sums is not bounded. Therefore, it follows from Theorem 3.7.5 that the harmonic
series is divergent. This series is famous for the very slow growth of its partial sums (see the

Since the partial sums of the harmonic series are not bounded, this inequality shows that the
partial sums of the p-series are not bounded when 0 &lt; p # 1. Hence the p-series diverges
for these values of p.

The reader should compare this series with the harmonic series in (b), which is
divergent. Thus, the subtraction of some of the terms in (7) is essential if this series is to
converge. Since we have

below by 0 and above by 1. Therefore they are both convergent and to the same value. Thus
the sequence (sn) of partial sums converges, proving that the alternating harmonic series (7)
&amp;
converges. (It is far from obvious that the limit of this series is equal to ln 2.)

Comparison Tests
Our first test shows that if the terms of a nonnegative series are dominated by the
corresponding terms of a convergent series, then the first series is convergent.

for some K 2 N we have

Remark The Comparison Tests 3.7.7 and 3.7.8 depend on having a stock of series that

CHAPTER 4

LIMITS

‘‘Mathematical analysis’’ is generally understood to refer to that area of mathematics in
which systematic use is made of various limiting concepts. In the preceding chapter we
studied one of these basic limiting concepts: the limit of a sequence of real numbers. In this
chapter we will encounter the notion of the limit of a function.
The rudimentary notion of a limiting process emerged in the 1680s as Isaac Newton
(1642–1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) struggled with the creation of the
Calculus. Though each person’s work was initially unknown to the other and their creative
insights were quite different, both realized the need to formulate a notion of function and
the idea of quantities being ‘‘close to’’ one another. Newton used the word ‘‘fluent’’ to
denote a relationship between variables, and in his major work Principia in 1687 he
discussed limits ‘‘to which they approach nearer than by any given difference, but never go
beyond, nor in effect attain to, till the quantities are diminished in infinitum.’’ Leibniz
introduced the term ‘‘function’’ to indicate a quantity that depended on a variable, and he
invented ‘‘infinitesimally small’’ numbers as a way of handling the concept of a limit. The
term ‘‘function’’ soon became standard terminology, and Leibniz also introduced the term
‘‘calculus’’ for this new method of calculation.
In 1748, Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) published his two-volume treatise Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum, in which he discussed power series, the exponential and
logarithmic functions, the trigonometric functions, and many related topics. This was
followed by Institutiones Calculi Differentialis in 1755 and the three-volume Institutiones Calculi Integralis in 1768–1770. These works remained the standard textbooks on
calculus for many years. But the concept of limit was very intuitive and its looseness
led to a number of problems. Verbal descriptions of the limit concept were proposed
by other mathematicians of the era, but none was adequate to provide the basis for
rigorous proofs.
In 1821, Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) published his lectures on analysis in his
Cours d’Analyse, which set the standard for mathematical exposition for many years. He
was concerned with rigor and in many ways raised the level of precision in mathematical
discourse. He formulated definitions and presented arguments with greater care than his
predecessors, but the concept of limit still remained elusive. In an early chapter he gave the
following definition:
If the successive values attributed to the same variable approach indefinitely a
fixed value, such that they finally differ from it by as little as one wishes, this latter
is called the limit of all the others.
The final steps in formulating a precise definition of limit were taken by Karl
Weierstrass (1815–1897). He insisted on precise language and rigorous proofs, and his
definition of limit is the one we use today.

Gottfried Leibniz
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) was born in Leipzig, Germany.
He was six years old when his father, a professor of philosophy, died and
left his son the key to his library and a life of books and learning. Leibniz
entered the University of Leipzig at age 15, graduated at age 17, and
received a Doctor of Law degree from the University of Altdorf four years
later. He wrote on legal matters, but was more interested in philosophy. He
also developed original theories about language and the nature of the
universe. In 1672, he went to Paris as a diplomat for four years. While
there he began to study mathematics with the Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens. His
travels to London to visit the Royal Academy further stimulated his interest in mathematics. His
background in philosophy led him to very original, though not always rigorous, results.
Unaware of Newtons’s unpublished work, Leibniz published papers in the 1680s that
presented a method of finding areas that is known today as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
He coined the term ‘‘calculus’’ and invented the dy=dx and elongated S notations that are used
today. Unfortunately, some followers of Newton accused Leibniz of plagiarism, resulting in a
dispute that lasted until Leibniz’s death. Their approaches to calculus were quite different and it is
now evident that their discoveries were made independently. Leibniz is now renowned for his
work in philosophy, but his mathematical fame rests on his creation of the calculus.

Section 4.1 Limits of Functions
In this section we will introduce the important notion of the limit of a function. The
intuitive idea of the function f having a limit L at the point c is that the values f (x) are close
to L when x is close to (but different from) c. But it is necessary to have a technical way of
working with the idea of ‘‘close to’’ and this is accomplished in the e-d definition given
below.
In order for the idea of the limit of a function f at a point c to be meaningful, it is
necessary that f be defined at points near c. It need not be defined at the point c, but it should
be defined at enough points close to c to make the study interesting. This is the reason for
the following definition.
4.1.1 Definition Let A # R. A point c 2 R is a cluster point of A if for every d &gt; 0 there
exists at least one point x 2 A; x 6¼ c such that jx # cj &lt; d.
This definition is rephrased in the language of neighborhoods as follows: A point c is a
cluster point of the set A if every d-neighborhood V d ðcÞ ¼ ðc # d; c þ dÞ of c contains at
least one point of A distinct from c.
Note The point c may or may not be a member of A, but even if it is in A, it is ignored
when deciding whether it is a cluster point of A or not, since we explicitly require that there
be points in V d ðcÞ \ A distinct from c in order for c to be a cluster point of A.
For example, if A :¼ {1, 2}, then the point 1 is not a cluster point of A, since choosing
d :¼ 12 gives a neighborhood of 1 that contains no points of A distinct from 1. The same is
true for the point 2, so we see that A has no cluster points.

CHAPTER 4 LIMITS

4.1.2 Theorem A number c 2 R is a cluster point of a subset A of R if and only if there
exists a sequence (an) in A such that limðan Þ ¼ c and an 6¼ c for all n 2 N.
Proof. If c is a cluster point of A, then for any n 2 N the (l=n)-neighborhood V 1=n ðcÞ
contains at least one point an in A distinct from c. Then an 2 A; an 6¼ c, and jan # cj &lt; 1=n
implies limðan Þ ¼ c.
Conversely, if there exists a sequence (an) in Anfcg with limðan Þ ¼ c, then
for any d &gt; 0 there exists K such that if n # K, then an 2 V d ðcÞ. Therefore the
d-neighborhood V d ðcÞ of c contains the points an, for n # K, which belong to A and
are distinct from c.
Q.E.D.
The next examples emphasize that a cluster point of a set may or may not belong to
the set.
4.1.3 Examples (a) For the open interval A1 :¼ ð0; 1Þ, every point of the closed
interval [0,1] is a cluster point of A1. Note that the points 0, 1 are cluster points of A1,
but do not belong to A1. All the points of A1 are cluster points of A1.
(b) A finite set has no cluster points.
(c) The infinite set N has no cluster points.
(d) The set A4 :¼ f1=n : n 2 N g has only the point 0 as a cluster point. None of the points
in A4 is a cluster point of A4.
(e) If I :¼ ½0; 1#, then the set A5 :¼ I \ Q consists of all the rational numbers in I. It follows
&amp;
from the Density Theorem 2.4.8 that every point in I is a cluster point of A5.
Having made this brief detour, we now return to the concept of the limit of a function at
a cluster point of its domain.
The Definition of the Limit
We now state the precise definition of the limit of a function f at a point c. It is important to
note that in this definition, it is immaterial whether f is defined at c or not. In any case, we
exclude c from consideration in the determination of the limit.
4.1.4 Definition Let A # R, and let c be a cluster point of A. For a function f : A ! R, a
real number L is said to be a limit of f at c if, given any e &gt; 0, there exists a d &gt; 0 such that
if x 2 A and 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; d, then j f ðxÞ # Lj &lt; e.
Remarks (a) Since the value of d usually depends on e, we will sometimes write dðeÞ
instead of d to emphasize this dependence.
(b) The inequality 0 &lt; jx # cj is equivalent to saying x 6¼ c.
If L is a limit of f at c, then we also say that f converges to L at c. We often write
L ¼ lim f ðxÞ or
x!c

L ¼ lim f :
x!c

We also say that ‘‘f (x) approaches L as x approaches c.’’ (But it should be noted that the
points do not actually move anywhere.) The symbolism
f ðxÞ ! L

as

x!c

is also used sometimes to express the fact that f has limit L at c.

Page 105

4.1 LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS

105

If the limit of f at c does not exist, we say that f diverges at c.
Our first result is that the value L of the limit is uniquely determined. This uniqueness
is not part of the definition of limit, but must be deduced.
4.1.5 Theorem If f : A ! R and if c is a cluster point of A, then f can have only one
limit at c.
Proof. Suppose that numbers L and L0 satisfy Definition 4.1.4. For any e &gt; 0, there exists
dðe=2Þ &gt; 0 such that if x 2 A and 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; dðe=2Þ, then j f ðxÞ # Lj &lt; e=2. Also there
exists d0 ðe=2Þ such that if x 2 A and 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; d0 ðe=2Þ, then j f ðxÞ # L0 j &lt; e=2. Now
let d :¼ inf fdðe=2Þ; d0 ðe=2Þg. Then if x 2 A and 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; d, the Triangle Inequality
implies that
#
#
jL # L0 j # #L # f ðxÞ# þ j f ðxÞ # L0 j &lt; e=2 þ e=2 ¼ e:
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that L # L0 ¼ 0, so that L ¼ L0 .

Q.E.D.

The definition of limit can be very nicely described in terms of neighborhoods. (See
Figure 4.1.1.) We observe that because
V d ðcÞ ¼ ðc # d; c þ dÞ ¼ fx : jx # cj &lt; dg;
the inequality 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; d is equivalent to saying that x 6¼ c and x belongs to the
d-neighborhood V d ðcÞ of c. Similarly, the inequality j f ðxÞ # Lj &lt; e is equivalent to saying
that f (x) belongs to the e-neighborhood V e ðLÞ of L. In this way, we obtain the following
result. The reader should write out a detailed argument to establish the theorem.

Figure 4.1.1

The limit of f at c is L

4.1.6 Theorem Let f : A ! R and let c be a cluster point of A. Then the following
statements are equivalent.
(i) lim f ðxÞ ¼ L.
x!c
(ii) Given any e-neighborhood V e ðLÞ of L, there exists a d-neighborhood V d ðcÞ of c such
that if x 6¼ c is any point in V d ðcÞ \ A, then f (x) belongs to V e ðLÞ.
We now give some examples that illustrate how the definition of limit is applied.
4.1.7 Examples (a) lim b ¼ b.
x!c

To be more explicit, let f ðxÞ :¼ b for all x 2 R. We want to show that lim f ðxÞ ¼ b. If
x!c
e &gt; 0 is given, we let d :¼ 1. (In fact, any strictly positive d will serve the purpose.) Then if

0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; 1, we have j f ðxÞ # bj ¼ jb # bj ¼ 0 &lt; e. Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we
conclude from Definition 4.1.4 that lim f ðxÞ ¼ b.
x!c
(b) lim x ¼ c.
x!c

Let gðxÞ :¼ x for all x 2 R. If e &gt; 0, we choose dðeÞ :¼ e. Then if 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; dðeÞ,
we have jgðxÞ # cj ¼ jx # cj &lt; e. Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we deduce that lim g ¼ c.
x!c
(c) lim x2 ¼ c2 :
x!c

Let hðxÞ :¼ x2 for all x 2 R. We want to make the difference
#
# #
#
#hðxÞ # c2 # ¼ #x2 # c2 #

less than a preassigned e &gt; 0 by taking x sufficiently close to c. To do so, we note that
x2 # c2 ¼ ðx þ cÞðx # cÞ. Moreover, if jx # cj &lt; 1, then
jxj &lt; jcj þ 1

so that

jx þ cj # jxj þ jcj &lt; 2 jcj þ 1:

Therefore, if jx # cj &lt; 1, we have
# 2
#
#x # c2 # ¼ jx þ cjjx # cj &lt; ð2 jcj þ 1Þ jx # cj:
ð1Þ
Moreover this last term will be less than e provided we take jx # cj &lt; e=ð2jcj þ 1Þ.
Consequently, if we choose

e
dðeÞ :¼ inf 1;

2j c j þ 1
then if 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; dðeÞ, it will follow first that jx # cj &lt; 1 so that (1) is valid, and

Sequential Criterion for Limits
The following important formulation of limit of a function is in terms of limits of
sequences. This characterization permits the theory of Chapter 3 to be applied to the
study of limits of functions.
4.1.8 Theorem (Sequential Criterion) Let f : A ! R and let c be a cluster point of A.
Then the following are equivalent.
(i) lim f ¼ L:
x!c
(ii) For every sequence (xn) in A that converges to c such that xn 6¼ c for all n 2 N, the
sequence ( f(xn)) converges to L.
Proof. (i) ) (ii). Assume f has limit L at c, and suppose (xn) is a sequence in A with
limðxn Þ ¼ c and xn 6¼ c for all n. We must prove that the sequence ð f ðxn ÞÞ converges to L.
Let e &gt; 0 be given. Then by Definition 4.1.4, there exists d &gt; 0 such that if x 2 A satisfies

CHAPTER 4 LIMITS

0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; d, then f (x) satisfies j f ðxÞ # Lj &lt; e. We now apply the definition of
convergent sequence for the given d to obtain a natural number K(d) such that if n &gt;
K ðdÞ then jxn # cj &lt; d. But for each such xn we have j f ðxn Þ # Lj &lt; e. Thus if n &gt; K ðdÞ,
then j f ðxn Þ # Lj &lt; e. Therefore, the sequence ð f ðxn ÞÞ converges to L.
(ii) ) (i). [The proof is a contrapositive argument.] If (i) is not true, then there exists
an e0 -neighborhood V e0 ðLÞ such that no matter what d-neighborhood of c we pick, there
will be at least one number xd in A \ V d ðcÞ with xd 6¼ c such that f ðxd Þ 2
= V e0 ðLÞ. Hence for
every n 2 N, the (1=n)-neighborhood of c contains a number xn such that
0 &lt; jxn # cj &lt; 1=n

and

xn 2 A ;

for all

n2N:

but such that
j f ð xn Þ # L j # e 0

We conclude that the sequence (xn) in An{c} converges to c, but the sequence ð f ðxn ÞÞ does
not converge to L. Therefore we have shown that if (i) is not true, then (ii) is not true. We
Q.E.D.
conclude that (ii) implies (i).
We shall see in the next section that many of the basic limit properties of functions can
be established by using corresponding properties for convergent sequences. For example,
we know from our
with sequences that if (xn) is any sequence that converges to a
# work
#
number c, then x2n converges to c2. Therefore, by the sequential criterion, we can
conclude that the function hðxÞ :¼ x2 has limit lim hðxÞ ¼ c2 .
x!c

Divergence Criteria
It is often important to be able to show (i) that a certain number is not the limit of a function
at a point, or (ii) that the function does not have a limit at a point. The following result is a
consequence of (the proof of) Theorem 4.1.8. We leave the details of its proof as an
important exercise.
4.1.9 Divergence Criteria Let A # R, let f : A ! R and let c 2 R be a cluster
point of A.
(a) If L 2 R, then f does not have limit L at c if and only if there exists a sequence (xn) in A
with xn 6¼ c for all n 2 N such that the sequence (xn) converges to c but the sequence
ð f ðxn ÞÞ does not converge to L.
(b) The function f does not have a limit at c if and only if there exists a sequence (xn) in A
with xn 6¼ c for all n 2 N such that the sequence (xn) converges to c but the sequence
ð f ðxn ÞÞ does not converge in R.
We now give some applications of this result to show how it can be used.
4.1.10 Examples (a) lim ð1=xÞ does not exist in R.
x!0

As in Example 4.1.7(d), let wðxÞ :¼ 1=x for x &gt; 0. However, here we consider c ¼ 0.
The argument given in Example 4.1.7(d) breaks down if c ¼ 0 since we cannot obtain
a bound such as that in (2) of that example. Indeed, if we take the sequence (xn) with
xn :¼ 1=n for n 2 N, then limðxn Þ ¼ 0, but wðxn Þ ¼ 1=ð1=nÞ ¼ n. As we know, the
sequence ðwðxn ÞÞ ¼ ðnÞ is not convergent in R, since it is not bounded. Hence, by
Theorem 4.1.9(b), lim ð1=xÞ does not exist in R.

4.2 LIMIT THEOREMS

Section 4.2 Limit Theorems
We shall now obtain results that are useful in calculating limits of functions. These results
are parallel to the limit theorems established in Section 3.2 for sequences. In fact, in most
cases these results can be proved by using Theorem 4.1.8 and results from Section 3.2.
Alternatively, the results in this section can be proved by using e-d arguments that are very
similar to the ones employed in Section 3.2.
4.2.1 Definition Let A # R, let f : A ! R, and let c 2 R be a cluster point of A. We say
that f is bounded on a neighborhood of c if there exists a d-neighborhood V d ðcÞ of c and a
constant M &gt; 0 such that we have j f ðxÞj # M for all x 2 A \ V d ðcÞ.
4.2.2 Theorem If A # R and f : A ! R has a limit at c 2 R, then f is bounded on some
neighborhood of c.
Proof. If L :¼ lim f , then for e ¼ 1, there exists d &gt; 0 such that if 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; d, then
x!c

j f ðxÞ # Lj &lt; 1; hence (by Corollary 2.2.4(a)),
j f ðxÞj # jLj # j f ðxÞ # Lj &lt; 1:
Therefore, if x 2 A \ V d ðcÞ; x 6¼ c, then j f ðxÞj # jLj þ 1. If c 2
= A, we take M ¼ jLj þ 1,
while if c 2 A we take M :¼ supfj f ðcÞj; jLj þ 1g. It follows that if x 2 A \ V d ðcÞ, then
j f ðxÞj # M. This shows that f is bounded on the neighborhood V d ðcÞ of c.
Q.E.D.
The next definition is similar to the definition for sums, differences, products, and
quotients of sequences given in Section 3.2.
4.2.3 Definition Let A # R and let f and g be functions defined on A to R. We define the
sum f þ g, the difference f # g, and the product fg on A to R to be the functions given by
ð f þ gÞðxÞ :¼ f ðxÞ þ gðxÞ;
ð f # gÞðxÞ :¼ f ðxÞ # gðxÞ;
ð f gÞðxÞ :¼ f ðxÞgðxÞ
for all x 2 A. Further, if b 2 R, we define the multiple bf to be the function given by
ðbf ÞðxÞ :¼ bf ðxÞ

for all x 2 A :

Finally, if hðxÞ 6¼ 0 for x 2 A, we define the quotient f=h to be the function given by
#
f
f ðxÞ
for all
x 2 A:
ðxÞ :¼
h
hðxÞ
4.2.4 Theorem Let A # R, let f and g be functions on A to R, and let c 2 R be a cluster
point of A. Further, let b 2 R.

CHAPTER 4 LIMITS

Proof. One proof of this theorem is exactly similar to that of Theorem 3.2.3. Alternatively, it can be proved by making use of Theorems 3.2.3 and 4.1.8. For example, let (xn) be
any sequence in A such that xn 6¼ c for n 2 N, and c ¼ limðxn Þ. It follows from Theorem
4.1.8 that
limð f ðxn ÞÞ ¼ L;

limðgðxn ÞÞ ¼ M:

On the other hand, Definition 4.2.3 implies that
ð f gÞðxn Þ ¼ f ðxn Þgðxn Þ

for

n 2 N:

Therefore an application of Theorem 3.2.3 yields
limðð f gÞðxn ÞÞ ¼ limð f ðxn Þgðxn ÞÞ
¼ ½limð f ðxn ÞÞ# ½limðgðxn ÞÞ# ¼ LM:
Consequently, it follows from Theorem 4.1.8 that
lim ð f gÞ ¼ limðð f gÞðxn ÞÞ ¼ LM:

The other parts of this theorem are proved in a similar manner. We leave the details to
the reader.
Q.E.D.
Remark Let A # R, and let f 1 ; f 2 ; . . . ; f n be functions on A to R, and let c be a cluster
point of A. If Lk :¼ lim f k for k ¼ 1; . . . ; n; then it follows from Theorem 4.2.4 by an

Induction argument that
L1 þ L2 þ # # # þ Ln ¼ lim ð f 1 þ f 2 þ # # # þ f n Þ;

and
L1 # L2 # # # Ln ¼ limð f 1 # f 2 # # # f n Þ:

converges to c, then the sequence ð f ðxn ÞÞ converges to L. Since a # f ðxn Þ # b for all

We now state an analogue of the Squeeze Theorem 3.2.7. We leave its proof to the reader.

There are results that are parallel to Theorems 3.2.9 and 3.2.10; however, we will leave
them as exercises. We conclude this section with a result that is, in some sense, a partial
converse to Theorem 4.2.6.

then there exists a neighborhood Vd(c) of c such that f (x) &gt; 0 [respectively, f (x) &lt; 0] for
all x 2 A \ V d ðcÞ, x 6¼ c.
Proof. Let L :¼ lim f and suppose that L &gt; 0. We take e ¼ 12 L &gt; 0 in Definition 4.1.4, and
x!c

obtain a number d &gt; 0 such that if 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; d and x 2 A, then j f ðxÞ # Lj &lt; 12 L.
Therefore (why?) it follows that if x 2 A \ V d ðcÞ, x 6¼ c, then f ðxÞ &gt; 12 L &gt; 0.
If L &lt; 0, a similar argument applies.

Section 4.3 Some Extensions of the Limit Concepty
In this section, we shall present three types of extensions of the notion of a limit of a
function that often occur. Since all the ideas here are closely parallel to ones we have
already encountered, this section can be read easily.

This section can be largely omitted on a first reading of this chapter.

4.3 SOME EXTENSIONS OF THE LIMIT CONCEPT

117

One-Sided Limits
There are times when a function f may not possess a limit at a point c, yet a limit
does exist when the function is restricted to an interval on one side of the cluster
point c.
For example, the signum function considered in Example 4.1.10(b), and illustrated in Figure 4.1.2, has no limit at c ¼ 0. However, if we restrict the signum function
to the interval (0, 1), the resulting function has a limit of 1 at c ¼ 0. Similarly, if
we restrict the signum function to the interval (#1, 0), the resulting function has a limit
of #1 at c ¼ 0. These are elementary examples of right-hand and left-hand limits at
c ¼ 0.
4.3.1 Definition Let A 2 R and let f : A ! R.
(i)

If c 2 R is a cluster point of the set A \ ðc; 1Þ ¼ fx 2 A: x &gt; cg, then we say that
L 2 R is a right-hand limit of f at c and we write
lim f ¼ L

x!cþ

or

lim f ðxÞ ¼ L

x!cþ

if given any e &gt; 0 there exists a d ¼ dðeÞ &gt; 0 such that for all x 2 A with
0 &lt; x # c &lt; d, then j f ðxÞ # Lj &lt; e.
(ii) If c 2 R is a cluster point of the set A \ ð#1; cÞ ¼ fx 2 A: x &lt; cg, then we say that
L 2 R is a left-hand limit of f at c and we write
lim f ¼ L

x!c#

or

lim f ðxÞ ¼ L

x!c#

if given any e &gt; 0 there exists a d &gt; 0 such that for all x 2 A with 0 &lt; c # x &lt; d,
then j f ðxÞ # Lj &lt; e.
Notes (1) The limits lim f and lim f are called one-sided limits of f at c. It is possible
x!cþ
x!c#
that neither one-sided limit may exist. Also, one of them may exist without the other
existing. Similarly, as is the case for f ðxÞ :¼ sgnðxÞ at c ¼ 0, they may both exist and be
different.
(2) If A is an interval with left endpoint c, then it is readily seen that f : A ! R has a limit
at c if and only if it has a right-hand limit at c. Moreover, in this case the limit lim f and the
x!c
right-hand limit lim f are equal. (A similar situation occurs for the left-hand limit when A
x!cþ
is an interval with right endpoint c.)
The reader can show that f can have only one right-hand (respectively, left-hand) limit
at a point. There are results analogous to those established in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 for twosided limits. In particular, the existence of one-sided limits can be reduced to sequential
considerations.
4.3.2 Theorem Let A # R, let f : A ! R, and let c 2 R be a cluster point of A \ ðc; 1Þ.
Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i)
(ii)

lim f ¼ L.

x!cþ

For every sequence (xn) that converges to c such that xn 2 A and xn &gt; c for all
n 2 N, the sequence ð f ðxn ÞÞ converges to L.

hðxÞ ¼ 1= e1=x þ 1 ðx 6¼ 0Þ

Figure 4.3.1 Graph of
gðxÞ ¼ e1=x ðx 6¼ 0Þ

We leave the proof of this result (and the formulation and proof of the analogous
result for left-hand limits) to the reader. We will not take the space to write out the
formulations of the one-sided version of the other results in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
The following result relates the notion of the limit of a function to one-sided limits. We
leave its proof as an exercise.
4.3.3 Theorem Let A # R, let f : A ! R, and let c 2 R be a cluster point of both
of the sets A \ ðc; 1Þ and A \ ð#1; cÞ. Then lim f ¼ L if and only if
x!c
lim f ¼ L ¼ lim f .

x!cþ

x!c#

4.3.4 Examples (a) Let f ðxÞ :¼ sgnðxÞ.
We have seen in Example 4.1.10(b) that sgn does not have a limit at 0. It is clear that
lim sgnðxÞ ¼ þ1 and that lim sgnðxÞ ¼ #1. Since these one-sided limits are different, it

x!0þ

x!0#

also follows from Theorem 4.3.3 that sgn(x) does not have a limit at 0.
(b) Let gðxÞ :¼ e1=x for x 6¼ 0. (See Figure 4.3.1.)
We first show that g does not have a finite right-hand limit at c ¼ 0 since it is
not bounded on any right-hand neighborhood ð0; dÞ of 0. We shall make use of the
inequality
0 &lt; t &lt; et

ð1Þ

for t &gt; 0;

which will be proved later (see Corollary 8.3.3). It follows from (1) that if x &gt; 0, then
0 &lt; 1=x &lt; e1=x . Hence, if we take xn ¼ 1=n, then gðxn Þ &gt; n for all n 2 N. Therefore
lim e1=x does not exist in R.
x!0þ
However, lim e1=x ¼ 0. Indeed, if x &lt; 0 and we take t ¼ #1=x in (1) we obtain
x!0#

0 &lt; #1=x &lt; e#1=x . Since x &lt; 0, this implies that 0 &lt; e1=x &lt; #x for all x &lt; 0. It follows
from this inequality that lim e1=x ¼ 0.
x!0#
#
#
(c) Let hðxÞ :¼ 1= e1=x þ 1 for x 6¼ 0. (See Figure 4.3.2.)
We have seen in part (b) that 0 &lt; 1=x &lt; e1=x for x &gt; 0, whence
0&lt;
which implies that lim h ¼ 0.

&amp;

Infinite Limits
The function f ðxÞ :¼ 1=x2 for x 6¼ 0 (see Figure 4.3.3) is not bounded on a neighborhood
of 0, so it cannot have a limit in the sense of Definition 4.1.4. While the symbols
1ð¼ þ1Þ and #1 do not represent real numbers, it is sometimes useful to be able to
say that ‘‘f ðxÞ ¼ 1=x2 tends to 1 as x ! 0.’’ This use of #1 will not cause any
difficulties, provided we exercise caution and never interpret 1 or #1 as being real
numbers.

(b) Let gðxÞ :¼ 1=x for x 6¼ 0. (See Figure 4.3.4.)

CHAPTER 4 LIMITS

The function g does not tend to either 1 or #1 as x ! 0. For, if a &gt; 0 then gðxÞ &lt; a
for all x &lt; 0, so that g does not tend to 1 as x ! 0. Similarly, if b &lt; 0 then gðxÞ &gt; b for all
&amp;
x &gt; 0, so that g does not tend to #1 as x ! 0.
While many of the results in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 have extensions to this limiting
notion, not all of them do since #1 are not real numbers. The following result is an
analogue of the Squeeze Theorem 4.2.7. (See also Theorem 3.6.4.)
4.3.7 Theorem Let A # R, let f ; g : A ! R, and let c 2 R be a cluster point of A.
Suppose that f ðxÞ # gðxÞ for all x 2 A; x 6¼ c.
(a) If lim f ¼ 1, then lim g ¼ 1.
x!c

x!c

(b) If lim g ¼ #1, then lim f ¼ #1.
x!c

x!c

Proof. (a) If lim f ¼ 1 and a 2 R is given, then there exists dðaÞ &gt; 0 such that if
x!c

0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; dðaÞ and x 2 A, then f ðxÞ &gt; a. But since f ðxÞ # gðxÞ for all x 2 A; x 6¼ c,
it follows that if 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; dðaÞ and x 2 A, then gðxÞ &gt; a. Therefore lim g ¼ 1.
x!c

The proof of (b) is similar.

Q.E.D.

The function gðxÞ ¼ 1=x considered in Example 4.3.6(b) suggests that it might be
useful to consider one-sided infinite limits. We will define only right-hand infinite
limits.
4.3.8 Definition Let A # R and let f : A ! R. If c 2 R is a cluster point of the set
A \ ðc; 1Þ ¼ fx 2 A : x &gt; cg, then we say that f tends to 1 [respectively, #1] as
x ! cþ, and we write
h
i
lim f ¼ 1 respectively; lim f ¼ #1 ;
x!cþ

x!cþ

if for every a 2 R there is d ¼ dðaÞ &gt; 0 such that for all x 2 A with 0 &lt; x # c &lt; d, then
f ðxÞ &gt; a [respectively, f ðxÞ &lt; a].
4.3.9 Examples (a) Let gðxÞ :¼ 1=x for x 6¼ 0. We have noted in Example 4.3.6(b) that
lim g does not exist. However, it is an easy exercise to show that

x!0

lim ð1=xÞ ¼ 1 and

x!0þ

lim ð1=xÞ ¼ #1:

x!0#

(b) It was seen in Example 4.3.4(b) that the function gðxÞ :¼ e1=x for x 6¼ 0 is not
bounded on any interval ð0; dÞ; d &gt; 0. Hence the right-hand limit of e1=x as x ! 0þ does
not exist in the sense of Definition 4.3.1(i). However, since
1=x &lt; e1=x
it is readily seen that lim e
x!0þ

1=x

for

x &gt; 0;

¼ 1 in the sense of Definition 4.3.8.

&amp;

Limits at Infinity
It is also desirable to define the notion of the limit of a function as x ! 1. The definition as
x ! #1 is similar.

4.3.10 Definition Let A # R and let f : A ! R. Suppose that ða; 1Þ # A for some
a 2 R. We say that L 2 R is a limit of f as x ! 1, and write
lim f ¼ L or

x!1

lim f ðxÞ ¼ L ;

x!1

if given any e &gt; 0 there exists K ¼ KðeÞ &gt; a such that for any x &gt; K, then j f ðxÞ # Lj &lt; e.
The reader should note the close resemblance between 4.3.10 and the definition of a
limit of a sequence.
We leave it to the reader to show that the limits of f as x ! #1 are unique whenever
they exist. We also have sequential criteria for these limits; we shall only state the criterion
as x ! 1. This uses the notion of the limit of a properly divergent sequence (see
Definition 3.6.1).
4.3.11 Theorem Let A # R, let f : A ! R, and suppose that ða; 1Þ # A for some
a 2 R. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) L ¼ lim f .
x!1
(ii) For every sequence (xn) in A \ ða; 1Þ such that limðxn Þ ¼ 1, the sequence ð f ðxn ÞÞ
converges to L.
We leave it to the reader to prove this theorem and to formulate and prove the
companion result concerning the limit as x ! #1.
4.3.12 Examples (a) Let gðxÞ :¼ 1=x for x 6¼ 0.
It is an elementary exercise to show that lim ð1=xÞ ¼ 0 ¼ lim ð1=xÞ. (See Figure
x!1
x!#1
4.3.4.)
(b) Let f ðxÞ :¼ 1=x2 for x 6¼ 0.
The reader may show that lim ð1=x2 Þ ¼ 0 ¼ lim ð1=x2 Þ. (See Figure 4.3.3.) One
x!1

x!#1

way to do this is to show that if x # 1 then 0 # 1=x2 # 1=x. In view of part (a), this implies
that lim ð1=x2 Þ ¼ 0.
&amp;
x!1

Just as it is convenient to be able to say that f ðxÞ ! #1 as x ! c for c 2 R, it is
convenient to have the corresponding notion as x ! #1. We will treat the case where
x ! 1.
4.3.13 Definition Let A # R and let f : A ! R. Suppose that ða; 1Þ # A for some
a 2 A. We say that f tends to 1 [respectively, #1] as x ! 1, and write

x!1

if given any a 2 R there exists K ¼ KðaÞ &gt; a such that for any x &gt; K, then f ðxÞ &gt; a
[respectively, f ðxÞ &lt; a].
As before there is a sequential criterion for this limit.
4.3.14 Theorem Let A 2 R, let f : A ! R, and suppose that ða; 1Þ # A for some
a 2 R. Then the following statements are equivalent:

CHAPTER 5

CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

We now begin the study of the most important class of functions that arises in real analysis:
the class of continuous functions. The term ‘‘continuous’’ has been used since the time of
Newton to refer to the motion of bodies or to describe an unbroken curve, but it was not made
precise until the nineteenth century. Work of Bernhard Bolzano in 1817 and Augustin-Louis
Cauchy in 1821 identified continuity as a very significant property of functions and proposed
definitions, but since the concept is tied to that of limit, it was the careful work of Karl
Weierstrass in the 1870s that brought proper understanding to the idea of continuity.
We will first define the notions of continuity at a point and continuity on a set, and then
show that various combinations of continuous functions give rise to continuous functions.
Then in Section 5.3 we establish the fundamental properties that make continuous functions
so important. For instance, we will prove that a continuous function on a closed bounded
interval must attain a maximum and a minimum value. We also prove that a continuous
function must take on every value intermediate to any two values it attains. These properties
and others are not possessed by general functions, as various examples illustrate, and thus
they distinguish continuous functions as a very special class of functions.
In Section 5.4 we introduce the very important notion of uniform continuity. The
distinction between continuity and uniform continuity is somewhat subtle and was not fully
appreciated until the work of Weierstrass and the mathematicians of his era, but it proved to
be very significant in applications. We present one application to the idea of approximating
continuous functions by more elementary functions (such as polynomials).

Karl Weierstrass
Karl Weierstrass (¼Weierstrab) (1815–1897) was born in Westphalia,
Germany. His father, a customs officer in a salt works, insisted that he study
law and public finance at the University of Bonn, but he had more interest in
drinking and fencing, and left Bonn without receiving a diploma. He then
enrolled in the Academy of M€unster where he studied mathematics with
Christoph Gudermann. From 1841 to 1854 he taught at various gymnasia in
Prussia. Despite the fact that he had no contact with the mathematical world
during this time, he worked hard on mathematical research and was able to
publish a few papers, one of which attracted considerable attention. Indeed,
the University of K€onigsberg gave him an honorary doctoral degree for this work in 1855. The next
year, he secured positions at the Industrial Institute of Berlin and the University of Berlin. He
remained at Berlin until his death.
A methodical and painstaking scholar, Weierstrass distrusted intuition and worked to put
everything on a firm and logical foundation. He did fundamental work on the foundations of
arithmetic and analysis, on complex analysis, the calculus of variations, and algebraic geometry.
Due to his meticulous preparation, he was an extremely popular lecturer; it was not unusual for
him to speak about advanced mathematical topics to audiences of more than 250. Among his
auditors are counted Georg Cantor, Sonya Kovalevsky, G€
osta Mittag-Leffler, Max Planck, Otto
H€older, David Hilbert, and Oskar Bolza (who had many American doctoral students). Through his
writings and his lectures, Weierstrass had a profound influence on contemporary mathematics.

5.1 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

125

The notion of a ‘‘gauge’’ is introduced in Section 5.5 and is used to provide an alternative
method of proving the fundamental properties of continuous functions. The main significance of this concept, however, is in the area of integration theory where gauges are essential
in defining the generalized Riemann integral. This will be discussed in Chapter 10.
Monotone functions are an important class of functions with strong continuity
properties and they are discussed in Section 5.6.

Section 5.1 Continuous Functions
In this section, which is very similar to Section 4.1, we will define what it means to say that
a function is continuous at a point, or on a set. This notion of continuity is one of the central
concepts of mathematical analysis, and it will be used in almost all of the following
material in this book. Consequently, it is essential that the reader master it.
5.1.1 Definition Let A # R, let f : A ! R, and let c 2 A. We say that f is continuous at
c if, given any number e &gt; 0, there exists d &gt; 0 such that if x is any point of A satisfying
jx # cj &lt; d, then j f ðxÞ # f ðcÞj &lt; e.
If f fails to be continuous at c, then we say that f is discontinuous at c.
As with the definition of limit, the definition of continuity at a point can be formulated
very nicely in terms of neighborhoods. This is done in the next result. We leave the
verification as an important exercise for the reader. See Figure 5.1.1.

Figure 5.1.1

Given V e ð f ðcÞÞ, a neighborhood V d ðcÞ is to be determined

5.1.2 Theorem A function f : A ! R is continuous at a point c 2 A if and only if given
any e-neighborhood V e ð f ðcÞÞ of f (c) there exists a d-neighborhood V d ðcÞ of c such that if
x is any point of A \ V d ðcÞ, then f (x) belongs to V e ð f ðcÞÞ, that is,
f ðA \ V d ðcÞÞ # V e ð f ðcÞÞ:
Remarks (1) If c 2 A is a cluster point of A, then a comparison of Definitions 4.1.4
and 5.1.1 show that f is continuous at c if and only if

CHAPTER 5 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

Thus, if c is a cluster point of A, then three conditions must hold for f to be continuous at c:
(i) f must be defined at c (so that f (c) makes sense),
(ii) the limit of f at c must exist in R (so that lim f ðxÞ makes sense), and
x!c
(iii) these two values must be equal.
(2) If c 2 A is not a cluster point of A, then there exists a neighborhood V d ðcÞ of c such
that A \ V d ðcÞ ¼ fcg. Thus we conclude that a function f is automatically continuous at a
point c 2 A that is not a cluster point of A. Such points are often called ‘‘isolated points’’ of
A. They are of little practical interest to us, since they have no relation to a limiting process.
Since continuity is automatic for such points, we generally test for continuity only at cluster
points. Thus we regard condition (1) as being characteristic for continuity at c.
A slight modification of the proof of Theorem 4.1.8 for limits yields the following
sequential version of continuity at a point.
5.1.3 Sequential Criterion for Continuity A function f : A ! R is continuous at the
point c 2 A if and only if for every sequence (xn) in A that converges to c, the sequence
ð f ðxn ÞÞ converges to f (c).
The following Discontinuity Criterion is a consequence of the last theorem. It should
be compared with the Divergence Criterion 4.1.9(a) with L ¼ f (c). Its proof should be
written out in detail by the reader.
5.1.4 Discontinuity Criterion Let A # R, let f : A ! R, and let c 2 A. Then f is
discontinuous at c if and only if there exists a sequence (xn) in A such that (xn) converges
to c, but the sequence ð f ðxn ÞÞ does not converge to f (c).
So far we have discussed continuity at a point. To talk about the continuity of a
function on a set, we will simply require that the function be continuous at each point of the
set. We state this formally in the next definition.
5.1.5 Definition Let A # R and let f : A ! R. If B is a subset of A, we say that f is
continuous on the set B if f is continuous at every point of B.
5.1.6 Examples (a) The constant function f ðxÞ :¼ b is continuous on R.
It was seen in Example 4.1.7(a) that if c 2 R, then lim f ðxÞ ¼ b. Since f ðcÞ ¼ b, we
x!c
have lim f ðxÞ ¼ f ðcÞ, and thus f is continuous at every point c 2 R. Therefore f is
x!c

continuous on R.
(b) gðxÞ :¼ x is continuous on R.
It was seen in Example 4.1.7(b) that if c 2 R, then we have lim g ¼ c. Since gðcÞ ¼ c,
x!c
then g is continuous at every point c 2 R. Thus g is continuous on R.
(c) hðxÞ :¼ x2 is continuous on R.
It was seen in Example 4.1.7(c) that if c 2 R, then we have lim h ¼ c2 . Since
x!c
hðcÞ ¼ c2 , then h is continuous at every point c 2 R. Thus h is continuous on R.
(d) wðxÞ :¼ 1=x is continuous on A :¼ fx 2 R : x &gt; 0g.
It was seen in Example 4.1.7(d) that if c 2 A, then we have lim w ¼ 1=c. Since
x!c
wðcÞ ¼ 1=c, this shows that w is continuous at every point c 2 A. Thus w is continuous on A.

5.1 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

127

(e) wðxÞ :¼ 1=x is not continuous at x ¼ 0.
Indeed, if wðxÞ ¼ 1=x for x &gt; 0, then w is not defined for x ¼ 0, so it cannot be
continuous there. Alternatively, it was seen in Example 4.1.10(a) that lim w does not exist
x!0
in R, so w cannot be continuous at x ¼ 0.
(f) The signum function sgn is not continuous at 0.
The signum function was defined in Example 4.1.10(b), where it was also shown that
lim sgnðxÞ does not exist in R. Therefore sgn is not continuous at x ¼ 0 (even though sgn 0

x!0

is defined). It is an exercise to show that sgn is continuous at every point c 6¼ 0.

Note In the next two examples, we introduce functions that played a significant role in
the development of real analysis. Discontinuities are emphasized and it is not possible to
graph either of them satisfactorily. The intuitive idea of drawing a curve in the plane to
represent a function simply does not apply, and plotting a handful of points gives only a hint
of their character. In the nineteenth century, these functions clearly demonstrated the need
for a precise and rigorous treatment of the basic concepts of analysis. They will reappear in
later sections.
(g) Let A :¼ R and let f be Dirichlet’s ‘‘discontinuous function’’ defined by
#
f ðxÞ :¼

1 if
0 if

x is rational;
x is irrational:

We claim that f is not continuous at any point of R. (This function was introduced in 1829
by P. G. L. Dirichlet.)
Indeed, if c is a rational number, let (xn) be a sequence of irrational numbers that
converges to c. (Corollary 2.4.9 to the Density Theorem 2.4.8 assures us that such a
sequence does exist.) Since f ðxn Þ ¼ 0 for all n 2 N, we have limð f ðxn ÞÞ ¼ 0, while
f ðcÞ ¼ 1. Therefore f is not continuous at the rational number c.
On the other hand, if b is an irrational number, let ( yn) be a sequence of rational
numbers that converge to b. (The Density Theorem 2.4.8 assures us that such a sequence
does exist.) Since f ðyn Þ ¼ 1 for all n 2 N, we have limð f ð yn ÞÞ ¼ 1, while f ðbÞ ¼ 0.
Therefore f is not continuous at the irrational number b.
Since every real number is either rational or irrational, we deduce that f is not
continuous at any point in R.

CHAPTER 5 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

(h) Let A :¼ fx 2 R : x &gt; 0g. For any irrational number x &gt; 0 we define hðxÞ :¼ 0.
For a rational number in A of the form m=n, with natural numbers m, n having no
common factors except 1, we define hðm=nÞ :¼ 1=n. (We also define hð0Þ :¼ 1.)
We claim that h is continuous at every irrational number in A, and is discontinuous at
every rational number in A. (This function was introduced in 1875 by K. J. Thomae.)
Indeed, if a &gt; 0 is rational, let (xn) be a sequence of irrational numbers in
A that converges to a. Then limðhðxn ÞÞ ¼ 0, while h(a) &gt; 0. Hence h is discontinuous
at a.
On the other hand, if b is an irrational number and e &gt; 0, then (by the Archimedean
Property) there is a natural number n0 such that 1=n0 &lt; e. There are only a finite number
of rationals with denominator less than n0 in the interval ðb # 1; b þ 1Þ. (Why?) Hence
d &gt; 0 can be chosen so small that the neighborhood ðb # d; b þ dÞ contains no rational
numbers with denominator less than n0. It then follows that for jx # bj &lt; d; x 2 A,
we have jhðxÞ # hðbÞj ¼ jhðxÞj # 1=n0 &lt; e. Thus h is continuous at the irrational
number b.
Consequently, we deduce that Thomae’s function h is continuous precisely at the
&amp;
irrational points in A. (See Figure 5.1.2.)
5.1.7 Remarks (a) Sometimes a function f : A ! R is not continuous at a point c
because it is not defined at this point. However, if the function f has a limit L at the point c
and if we define F on A [ fcg ! R by
#
FðxÞ :¼

L
f ðxÞ

for
for

x ¼ c;
x 2 A;

then F is continuous at c. To see this, one needs to check that lim F ¼ L, but this follows
x!c
(why?), since lim f ¼ L.
x!c
(b) If a function g : A ! R does not have a limit at c, then there is no way that we can
obtain a function G : A [ fcg ! R that is continuous at c by defining
#
GðxÞ :¼

C
gðxÞ

for
for

x ¼ c;
x 2 A:

To see this, observe that if lim G exists and equals C, then lim g must also exist and
x!c
x!c
equal C.
5.1.8 Examples (a) The function gðxÞ :¼ sinð1=xÞ for x 6¼ 0 (see Figure 4.1.3) does
not have a limit at x ¼ 0 (see Example 4.1.10(c)). Thus there is no value that we can assign
at x ¼ 0 to obtain a continuous extension of g at x ¼ 0.
(b) Let f ðxÞ :¼ x sin ð1=xÞ for x 6¼ 0. (See Figure 5.1.3.) It was seen in Example 4.2.8(f)
that lim ðx sinð1=xÞÞ ¼ 0. Therefore it follows from Remark 5.1.7(a) that if we define

F : R ! R by

Section 5.2 Combinations of Continuous Functions
Let A # R and let f and g be functions that are defined on A to R and let b 2 R. In Definition
4.2.3 we defined the sum, difference, product, and multiple functions denoted by
f þ g; f # g; f g; bf . In addition, if h : A ! R is such that hðxÞ 6¼ 0 for all x 2 A, then
we defined the quotient function denoted by f =h.
The next result is similar to Theorem 4.2.4, from which it follows.
5.2.1 Theorem Let A # R, let f and g be functions on A to R, and let b 2 R. Suppose
that c 2 A and that f and g are continuous at c.
(a) Then f þ g; f # g; f g, and bf are continuous at c.
(b) If h : A ! R is continuous at c 2 A and if hðxÞ 6¼ 0 for all x 2 A, then the quotient
f=h is continuous at c.
Proof. If c 2 A is not a cluster point of A, then the conclusion is automatic. Hence we
assume that c is a cluster point of A.
(a) Since f and g are continuous at c, then
f ðcÞ ¼ lim f and gðcÞ ¼ lim g:
x!c

x!c

Hence it follows from Theorem 4.2.4(a) that
ð f þ gÞðcÞ ¼ f ðcÞ þ gðcÞ ¼ lim ð f þ gÞ:
x!c

Therefore f þ g is continuous at c. The remaining assertions in part (a) are proved in a
similar fashion.
(b) Since c 2 A, then hðcÞ 6¼ 0. But since hðcÞ ¼ lim h, it follows from Theorem 4.2.4(b)
x!c
that
# #

Therefore f=h is continuous at c.

Q.E.D.

The next result is an immediate consequence of Theorem 5.2.1, applied to every point
of A. However, since it is an extremely important result, we shall state it formally.
5.2.2 Theorem Let A # R, let f and g be continuous on A to R, and let b 2 R.
(a) The functions f þ g; f # g; f g, and bf are continuous on A.
(b) If h : A ! R is continuous on A and hðxÞ 6¼ 0 for x 2 A, then the quotient f=h is
continuous on A.

Remark To define quotients, it is sometimes more convenient to proceed as follows. If
w : A ! R, let A1 :¼ fx 2 A : wðxÞ 6¼ 0g. We can define the quotient f =w on the set A1 by
ð1Þ

# #
f
f ðxÞ
ðxÞ :¼
w
w ðxÞ

for

x 2 A1 :

If w is continuous at a point c 2 A1 , it is clear that the restriction w1 of w to A1 is also
continuous at c. Therefore it follows from Theorem 5.2.1(b) applied to w1 that f =w1
is continuous at c 2 A. Since ð f =wÞðxÞ ¼ ð f =w1 ÞðxÞ for x 2 A1 it follows that f =w is
continuous at c 2 A1 . Similarly, if f and w are continuous on A, then the function f =w,
defined on A1 by (1), is continuous on A1.
5.2.3 Examples (a) Polynomial functions.
If p is a polynomial function, so that pðxÞ ¼ an xn þ an#1 xn#1 þ # # # þ a1 x þ a0 for all
x 2 R, then it follows from Example 4.2.5(f) that pðcÞ ¼ lim p for any c 2 R. Thus a
x!c
polynomial function is continuous on R.
(b) Rational functions.
If p and q are polynomial functions on R, then there are at most a finite number
a1 ; . . . ; am of real roots of q. If x 2
= fa1 ; . . . ; am g then qðxÞ 6¼ 0 so that we can define the
rational function r by
rðxÞ :¼

pðxÞ
qðxÞ

for

x2
= fa1 ; . . . ; am g :

It was seen in Example 4.2.5(g) that if qðcÞ 6¼ 0, then
rðcÞ ¼

pðcÞ
pðxÞ
¼ lim
¼ lim rðxÞ:
qðcÞ x!c qðxÞ x!c

In other words, r is continuous at c. Since c is any real number that is not a root of q, we
infer that a rational function is continuous at every real number for which it is defined.
(c) We shall show that the sine function sin is continuous on R.
To do so we make use of the following properties of the sine and cosine functions.
(See Section 8.4.) For all x, y, z 2 R we have:
jsin zj # jzj; jcos zj # 1;
#
# #
#
sin x # sin y ¼ 2 sin 12ðx # yÞ cos 12ðx þ yÞ :
Hence if c 2 R, then we have
jsin x # sin cj # 2 # 12 jx # cj # 1 ¼ jx # cj:
Therefore sin is continuous at c. Since c 2 R is arbitrary, it follows that sin is continuous
on R.
(d) The cosine function is continuous on R.
We make use of the following properties of the sine and cosine functions. For all
x; y; z 2 R we have:
jsin zj # jzj; jsin zj # 1;
#
# #
#
cos x # cos y ¼ #2 sin 12ðx þ yÞ sin 12ðx # yÞ :
Hence if c 2 R, then we have
jcos x # cos cj # 2 # 1 # 12jc # xj ¼ jx # cj:

CHAPTER 5 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

Therefore cos is continuous at c. Since c 2 R is arbitrary, it follows that cos is continuous
on R. (Alternatively, we could use the relation cos x ¼ sinðx þ p=2Þ.)
(e) The functions tan, cot, sec, csc are continuous where they are defined.
For example, the cotangent function is defined by
cos x
cot x :¼
sin x
provided sin x 6¼ 0 (that is, provided x 6¼ np; n 2 Z). Since sin and cos are continuous on
R, it follows (see the Remark before Example 5.2.3) that the function cot is continuous
&amp;
on its domain. The other trigonometric functions are treated similarly.
5.2.4 Theorem Let A # R, let f : A ! R, and let j f j be defined by j f jðxÞ :¼ j f ðxÞj for
x 2 A.
(a) If f is continuous at a point c 2 A, then j f j is continuous at c.
(b) If f is continuous on A, then j f j is continuous on A.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Exercise 4.2.14.

Composition of Continuous Functions
We now show that if the function f : A ! R is continuous at a point c and if g : B ! R is
continuous at b ¼ f (c), then the composition g # f is continuous at c. In order to assure that
g # f is defined on all of A, we also need to assume that f ðAÞ # B.
5.2.6 Theorem Let A, B # R and let f : A ! R and g : B ! R be functions such that
f ðAÞ # B. If f is continuous at a point c 2 A and g is continuous at b ¼ f ðcÞ 2 B, then the
composition g # f : A ! R is continuous at c.
Proof. Let W be an e-neighborhood of g(b). Since g is continuous at b, there is a
d-neighborhood V of b ¼ f ðcÞ such that if y 2 B \ V then gðyÞ 2 W. Since f is continuous
at c, there is a g-neighborhood U of c such that if x 2 A \ U, then f ðxÞ 2 V. (See
Figure 5.2.1.) Since f ðAÞ # B, it follows that if x 2 A \ U, then f ðxÞ 2 B \ V so that
g # f ðxÞ ¼ gð f ðxÞÞ 2 W. But since W is an arbitrary e-neighborhood of g(b), this implies
that g # f is continuous at c.

5.2.7 Theorem Let A; B # R, let f : A ! R be continuous on A, and let g : B ! R be
continuous on B. If f ðAÞ # B, then the composite function g # f : A ! R is continuous on A.
Proof. The theorem follows immediately from the preceding result, if f and g are
continuous at every point of A and B, respectively.

The composition of f and g

Theorems 5.2.6 and 5.2.7 are very useful in establishing that certain functions are
continuous. They can be used in many situations where it would be difficult to apply the
definition of continuity directly.
5.2.8 Examples (a) Let g1 ðxÞ :¼ jxj for x 2 R. It follows from the Triangle Inequality
that
jg1 ðxÞ # g1 ðcÞj # jx # cj
for all x; c 2 R. Hence g1 is continuous at c 2 R. If f : A ! R is any function that is
continuous on A, then Theorem 5.2.7 implies that g1 # f ¼ j f j is continuous on A. This
gives another proof of Theorem 5.2.4.
pﬃﬃﬃ
(b) Let g2 ðxÞ :¼ x for x # 0. It follows from Theorems 3.2.10 and 5.1.3 that g2 is
continuous at any number c # 0. If f : A ! R is continuous
pﬃﬃﬃ on A and if f ðxÞ # 0 for all
x 2 A, then it follows from Theorem 5.2.7 that g2 # f ¼ f is continuous on A. This gives
another proof of Theorem 5.2.5.
(c) Let g3 ðxÞ :¼ sin x for x 2 R. We have seen in Example 5.2.3(c) that g3 is continuous
on R. If f : A ! R is continuous on A, then it follows from Theorem 5.2.7 that g3 # f is
continuous on A.
In particular, if f ðxÞ :¼ 1=x for x 6¼ 0, then the function gðxÞ :¼ sinð1=xÞ is continuous at every point c 6¼ 0. [We have seen, in Example 5.1.8(a), that g cannot be defined at
&amp;
0 in order to become continuous at that point.]

Section 5.3 Continuous Functions on Intervals
Functions that are continuous on intervals have a number of very important properties that
are not possessed by general continuous functions. In this section, we will establish some
deep results that are of considerable importance and that will be applied later. Alternative
proofs of these results will be given in Section 5.5.
5.3.1 Definition A function f : A ! R is said to be bounded on A if there exists a
constant M &gt; 0 such that j f ðxÞj # M for all x 2 A.
In other words, a function is bounded on a set if its range is a bounded set in R. To say
that a function is not bounded on a given set is to say that no particular number can serve
as a bound for its range. In exact language, a function f is not bounded on the set A if given
any M &gt; 0, there exists a point xM 2 A such that j f ðxM Þj &gt; M. We often say that f is
unbounded on A in this case.
For example, the function f defined on the interval A :¼ ð0; 1Þ by f ðxÞ :¼ 1=x is not
bounded on A because for any M &gt; 0 we can take the point xM :¼ 1=ðM þ 1Þ in A to get
f ðxM Þ ¼ 1=xM ¼ M þ 1 &gt; M. This example shows that continuous functions need not be

bounded. In the next theorem, however, we show that continuous functions on a certain
type of interval are necessarily bounded.
5.3.2 Boundedness Theoremy Let I :¼ ½a; b# be a closed bounded interval and let
f : I ! R be continuous on I. Then f is bounded on I.
Proof. Suppose that f is not bounded on I. Then, for any n 2 N there is a number xn 2 I
such that j f ðxn Þj &gt; n. Since I is bounded, the sequence X :¼ ðxn Þ is bounded. Therefore,
the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 3.4.8 implies that there is a subsequence X 0 ¼ ðxnr Þ of X
that converges to a number x. Since I is closed and the elements of X 0 belong to I, it follows
from Theorem 3.2.6 that x 2 I. Then f is continuous at x, so that ð f ðxnr ÞÞ converges to f ðxÞ.
We then conclude from Theorem 3.2.2 that the convergent sequence ðf ðxnr ÞÞ must be
bounded. But this is a contradiction since
j f ðxnr Þj &gt; nr # r for

r 2 N:

Therefore the supposition that the continuous function f is not bounded on the closed
bounded interval I leads to a contradiction.
Q.E.D.
To show that each hypothesis of the Boundedness Theorem is needed, we can
construct examples that show the conclusion fails if any one of the hypotheses is relaxed.
(i) The interval must be bounded. The function f ðxÞ :¼ x for x in the unbounded,
closed interval A :¼ ½0; 1Þ is continuous but not bounded on A.
(ii) The interval must be closed. The function gðxÞ :¼ 1=x for x in the half-open
interval B :¼ ð0; 1# is continuous but not bounded on B.
(iii) The function must be continuous. The function h defined on the closed interval
C :¼ ½0; 1# by hðxÞ :¼ 1=x for x 2 ð0; 1# and hð0Þ :¼ 1 is discontinuous and unbounded
on C.
The Maximum-Minimum Theorem
5.3.3 Definition Let A # R and let f : A ! R. We say that f has an absolute maximum
on A if there is a point x 2 A such that
f ðx Þ # f ðxÞ for all x 2 A:
We say that f has an absolute minimum on A if there is a point x 2 A such that
f ðx Þ # f ðxÞ

for all

x 2 A:

We say that x is an absolute maximum point for f on A, and that x is an absolute
minimum point for f on A, if they exist.
We note that a continuous function on a set A does not necessarily have an absolute
maximum or an absolute minimum on the set. For example, f ðxÞ :¼ 1=x has neither an
absolute maximum nor an absolute minimum on the set A :¼ ð0; 1Þ. (See Figure 5.3.1.)
There can be no absolute maximum for f on A since f is not bounded above on A, and there
is no point at which f attains the value 0 ¼ inff f ðxÞ : x 2 Ag. The same function has
y
This theorem, as well as 5.3.4, is true for an arbitrary closed bounded set. For these developments, see Sections
11.2 and 11.3.

The function
ðjxj # 1Þ

neither an absolute maximum nor an absolute minimum when it is restricted to the set
(0, 1), while it has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum when it is
restricted to the set [1, 2]. In addition, f ðxÞ ¼ 1=x has an absolute maximum but no
absolute minimum when restricted to the set [1, 1), but no absolute maximum and no
absolute minimum when restricted to the set (1, 1).
It is readily seen that if a function has an absolute maximum point, then this point is
not necessarily uniquely determined. For example, the function gðxÞ :¼ x2 defined for
x 2 A :¼ ½#1; þ1# has the two points x ¼ 1 giving the absolute maximum on A, and the
single point x ¼ 0 yielding its absolute minimum on A. (See Figure 5.3.2.) To pick an
extreme example, the constant function hðxÞ :¼ 1 for x 2 R is such that every point of R is
both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum point for h.
5.3.4 Maximum-Minimum Theorem Let I :¼ ½a; b# be a closed bounded interval and
let f : I ! R be continuous on I. Then f has an absolute maximum and an absolute
minimum on I.
Proof. Consider the nonempty set f ðIÞ :¼ ff ðxÞ : x 2 Ig of values of f on I. In Theorem 5.3.2
it was established that f (I ) is a bounded subset of R. Let s :¼ sup f ðIÞ and s :¼ inf f ðI Þ.
We claim that there exist points x and x in I such that s ¼ f ðx Þ and s ¼ f ðx Þ. We will
establish the existence of the point x , leaving the proof of the existence of x to the reader.
Since s ¼ sup f ðIÞ, if n 2 N, then the number s # 1=n is not an upper bound of the
set f (I). Consequently there exists a number xn 2 I such that
ð1Þ

1
s # &lt; f ðxn Þ # s
n

for all

n 2 N:

Since I is bounded, the sequence X :¼ ðxn Þ is bounded. Therefore, by the BolzanoWeierstrass Theorem 3.4.8, there is a subsequence X 0 ¼ ðxnr Þ of X that converges to some
number x . Since the elements of X0 belong to I ¼ ½a; b#, it follows from Theorem 3.2.6 that
x 2 I. Therefore f is continuous at x so that limð f ðxnr ÞÞ ¼ f ðx Þ. Since it follows from
(1) that
s #

1
&lt; f ðxnr Þ # s
nr

for all

r 2 N;

we conclude from the Squeeze Theorem 3.2.7 that limð f ðxnr ÞÞ ¼ s . Therefore we have
f ðx Þ ¼ limð f ðxnr ÞÞ ¼ s ¼ sup f ðIÞ:
We conclude that x is an absolute maximum point of f on I.

5.3 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS ON INTERVALS

The next result is the theoretical basis for locating roots of a continuous function by
means of sign changes of the function. The proof also provides an algorithm, known as the
Bisection Method, for the calculation of roots to a specified degree of accuracy and can be
readily programmed for a computer. It is a standard tool for finding solutions of equations
of the form f (x) ¼ 0, where f is a continuous function. An alternative proof of the theorem
is indicated in Exercise 5.3.11.
5.3.5 Location of Roots Theorem Let I ¼ ½a; b# and let f : I ! R be continuous on I. If
f ðaÞ &lt; 0 &lt; f ðbÞ, or if f ðaÞ &gt; 0 &gt; f ðbÞ, then there exists a number c 2 ða; bÞ such that
f ðcÞ ¼ 0.
Proof. We assume that f ðaÞ &lt; 0 &lt; f ðbÞ. We will generate a sequence of intervals by
successive bisections. Let I 1 :¼ ½a1 ; b1 #, where a1 :¼ a; b1 :¼ b, and let p1 be the midpoint
p1 :¼ 12 ða1 þ b1 Þ. If f ðp1 Þ ¼ 0, we take c :¼ p1 and we are done. If f ðp1 Þ 6¼ 0, then either
f ðp1 Þ &gt; 0 or f ðp1 Þ &lt; 0. If f ðp1 Þ &gt; 0, then we set a2 :¼ a1 ; b2 :¼ p1 , while if f ðp1 Þ &lt; 0,
then we set a2 :¼ p1 ; b2 :¼ b1 . In either case, we let I 2 :¼ ½a2 ; b2 #; then we have I 2 I 1 and
f ða2 Þ &lt; 0; f ðb2 Þ &gt; 0.
We continue the bisection process. Suppose that the intervals I 1 ; I 2 ; . . . ; I k have
been obtained by successive bisection in the same manner. Then we have f ðak Þ &lt; 0 and
f ðbk Þ &gt; 0, and we set pk :¼ 12 ðak þ bk Þ. If f ðpk Þ ¼ 0, we take c :¼ pk and we are done.
If f ðpk Þ &gt; 0, we set akþ1 :¼ ak ; bkþ1 :¼ pk , while if f ðpk Þ &lt; 0, we set akþ1 :¼
pk ; bkþ1 :¼ bk . In either case, we let I kþ1 :¼ ½akþ1 ; bkþ1 #; then I kþ1 I k and
f ðakþ1 Þ &lt; 0; f ðbkþ1 Þ &gt; 0.
If the process terminates by locating a point pn such that f ðpn Þ ¼ 0, then we are done.
If the process does not terminate, then we obtain a nested sequence of closed bounded
intervals I n :¼ ½an ; bn # such that for every n 2 N we have
f ðan Þ &lt; 0

and f ðbn Þ &gt; 0:

Furthermore, since the intervals are obtained by repeated bisection, the length of In is
equal to bn # an ¼ ðb # aÞ=2n#1 . It follows from the Nested Intervals Property 2.5.2
that there exists a point c that belongs to In for all n 2 N. Since an # c # bn for all
n 2 N and limðbn # an Þ ¼ 0, it follows that limðan Þ ¼ c ¼ limðbn Þ. Since f is continuous
at c, we have
lim ð f ðan ÞÞ ¼ f ðcÞ ¼ lim ð f ðbn ÞÞ:
The fact that f ðan Þ &lt; 0 for all n 2 N implies that f ðcÞ ¼ lim ð f ðan ÞÞ # 0. Also, the fact
that f ðbn Þ &gt; 0 for all n 2 N implies that f ðcÞ ¼ lim ð f ðbn ÞÞ # 0. Thus, we conclude that
f ðcÞ ¼ 0. Consequently, c is a root of f.
Q.E.D.
The following example illustrates how the Bisection Method for finding roots is
applied in a systematic fashion.
5.3.6 Example The equation f ðxÞ ¼ xex # 2 ¼ 0 has a root c in the interval [0, 1],
because f is continuous on this interval and f ð0Þ ¼ #2 &lt; 0 and f ð1Þ ¼ e # 2 &gt; 0. Using a
calculator we construct the following table, where the sign of f ( pn) determines the interval
at the next step. The far right column is an upper bound on the error when pn is used to
approximate the root c, because we have
jpn # cj # 12 ðbn # an Þ ¼ 1=2n :

Bolzano’s Theorem
The next result is a generalization of the Location of Roots Theorem. It assures us that a
continuous function on an interval takes on (at least once) any number that lies between
two of its values.
5.3.7 Bolzano’s Intermediate Value Theorem Let I be an interval and let f : I ! R be
continuous on I. If a; b 2 I and if k 2 R satisfies f ðaÞ &lt; k &lt; f ðbÞ, then there exists a point
c 2 I between a and b such that f ðcÞ ¼ k.
Proof. Suppose that a &lt; b and let gðxÞ :¼ f ðxÞ # k; then gðaÞ &lt; 0 &lt; gðbÞ. By the Location
of Roots Theorem 5.3.5 there exists a point c with a &lt; c &lt; b such that 0 ¼ gðcÞ ¼ f ðcÞ # k.
Therefore f ðcÞ ¼ k.
If b &lt; a, let hðxÞ :¼ k # f ðxÞ so that hðbÞ &lt; 0 &lt; hðaÞ. Therefore there exists a point c
with b &lt; c &lt; a such that 0 ¼ hðcÞ ¼ k # f ðcÞ, whence f ðcÞ ¼ k.
Q.E.D.
5.3.8 Corollary Let I ¼ ½a; b# be a closed, bounded interval and let f : I ! R be
continuous on I. If k 2 R is any number satisfying
inf f ðIÞ # k # sup f ðIÞ;
then there exists a number c 2 I such that f ðcÞ ¼ k.
Proof. It follows from the Maximum-Minimum Theorem 5.3.4 that there are points c
and c in I such that
inf f ðIÞ ¼ f ðc Þ # k # f ðc Þ ¼ sup f ðIÞ:
The conclusion now follows from Bolzano’s Theorem 5.3.7.

Q.E.D.

The next theorem summarizes the main results of this section. It states that the image
of a closed bounded interval under a continuous function is also a closed bounded interval.
The endpoints of the image interval are the absolute minimum and absolute maximum
values of the function, and the statement that all values between the absolute minimum
and the absolute maximum values belong to the image is a way of describing Bolzano’s
Intermediate Value Theorem.

5.3.9 Theorem Let I be a closed bounded interval and let f : I ! R be continuous on I.
Then the set f ðIÞ :¼ f f ðxÞ : x 2 Ig is a closed bounded interval.
Proof. If we let m :¼ inf f ðIÞ and M :¼ sup f ðIÞ, then we know from the MaximumMinimum Theorem 5.3.4 that m and M belong to f (I). Moreover, we have f ðIÞ # ½m; M#. If
k is any element of [m, M], then it follows from the preceding corollary that there exists a
point c 2 I such that k ¼ f ðcÞ. Hence, k 2 f ðIÞ and we conclude that ½m; M# # f ðIÞ.
Therefore, f (I) is the interval [m, M].
Q.E.D.
Warning If I :¼ ½a; b# is an interval and f : I ! R is continuous on I, we have proved
that f (I) is the interval [m, M]. We have not proved (and it is not always true) that f (I) is the
&amp;
interval ½ f ðaÞ; f ðbÞ#. (See Figure 5.3.3.)

f ðIÞ ¼ ½m; M#

The preceding theorem is a ‘‘preservation’’ theorem in the sense that it states that the
continuous image of a closed bounded interval is a set of the same type. The next theorem
extends this result to general intervals. However, it should be noted that although the
continuous image of an interval is shown to be an interval, it is not true that the image
interval necessarily has the same form as the domain interval. For example, the continuous
image of an open interval need not be an open interval, and the continuous image of an
unbounded closed interval need not be a closed interval. Indeed, if f ðxÞ :¼ 1=ðx2 þ 1Þ for
x 2 R, then f is continuous# on# R [see Example 5.2.3(b)]. It is easy to see that if
I 1 :¼ ð#1; 1Þ, then f ðI 1 Þ ¼ 12 ; 1 , which is not an open interval. Also, if I 2 :¼ ½0; 1Þ,
then f ðI 2 Þ ¼ ð0; 1#, which is not a closed interval. (See Figure 5.3.4.)

CHAPTER 5 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

To prove the Preservation of Intervals Theorem 5.3.10, we will use Theorem 2.5.1
characterizing intervals.
5.3.10 Preservation of Intervals Theorem Let I be an interval and let f : I ! R be
continuous on I. Then the set f (I) is an interval.
Proof. Let a; b 2 f ðIÞ with a &lt; b; then there exist points a; b 2 I such that a ¼ f ðaÞ
and b ¼ f ðbÞ. Further, it follows from Bolzano’s Intermediate Value Theorem 5.3.7
that if k 2 ða; bÞ then there exists a number c 2 I with k ¼ f ðcÞ 2 f ðIÞ. Therefore
½a; b# # f ðIÞ, showing that f (I ) possesses property (1) of Theorem 2.5.1. Therefore
f (I ) is an interval.

Section 5.4 Uniform Continuity
Let A # R and let f : A ! R. Definition 5.1.1 states that the following statements are
equivalent:
(i) f is continuous at every point u 2 A;
(ii) given e &gt; 0 and u 2 A, there is a dðe; uÞ &gt; 0 such that for all x such that x 2 A
and jx # uj &lt; dðe; uÞ, then j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj &lt; e.
The point we wish to emphasize here is that d depends, in general, on both e &gt; 0 and
u 2 A. The fact that d depends on u is a reflection of the fact that the function f may change
its values rapidly near certain points and slowly near other points. [For example, consider
f ðxÞ :¼ sinð1=xÞ for x &gt; 0; see Figure 4.1.3.]
Now it often happens that the function f is such that the number d can be chosen to be
independent of the point u 2 A and to depend only on e. For example, if f ðxÞ :¼ 2x for all
x 2 R, then
j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj ¼ 2jx # uj;
and so we can choose dðe; uÞ :¼ e=2 for all e &gt; 0 and all u 2 R. (Why?)
On the other hand if gðxÞ :¼ 1=x for x 2 A :¼ fx 2 R : x &gt; 0g, then
u#x
:
ð1Þ
gðxÞ # gðuÞ ¼
ux
If u 2 A is given and if we take
ð2Þ

dðe; uÞ :¼ inf

2 u; 2 u e

;

then if jx # uj &lt; dðe; uÞ, we have jx # uj &lt; 12 u so that 12 u &lt; x &lt; 32 u, whence it follows that
1=x &lt; 2=u. Thus, if jx # uj &lt; 12 u, the equality (1) yields the inequality
ð3Þ

jgðxÞ # gðuÞj # ð2=u2 Þjx # uj:

Consequently, if jx # uj &lt; dðe; uÞ, then (2) and (3) imply that
#
jgðxÞ # gðuÞj &lt; ð2=u2 Þ 12 u2 e ¼ e:
We have seen that the selection of dðe; uÞ by the formula (2) ‘‘works’’ in the sense that it
enables us to give a value of d that will ensure that jgðxÞ # gðuÞj &lt; e when jx # uj &lt; d and

x; u 2 A. We note that the value of dðe; uÞ given in (2) certainly depends on the point u 2 A.
If we wish to consider all u 2 A, formula (2) does not lead to one value dðeÞ &gt; 0 that will
‘‘work’’ simultaneously for all u &gt; 0, since inffdðe; uÞ : u &gt; 0g ¼ 0.
In fact, there is no way of choosing one value of d that will ‘‘work’’ for all u &gt; 0 for the
function gðxÞ ¼ 1=x. The situation is#exhibited graphically in Figures 5.4.1 and
# 5.4.2
where, for a given e-neighborhood V e 12 about 12 ¼ f ð2Þ and V e ð2Þ about 2 ¼ f 12 , the
corresponding maximum values of d are seen to be considerably different. As u tends to 0,
the permissible values of d tend to 0.

gðxÞ ¼ 1=x ðx &gt; 0Þ

gðxÞ ¼ 1=x ðx &gt; 0Þ

5.4.1 Definition Let A # R and let f : A ! R. We say that f is uniformly continuous
on A if for each e &gt; 0 there is a dðeÞ &gt; 0 such that if x; u 2 A are any numbers satisfying
jx # uj &lt; dðeÞ, then j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj &lt; e.
It is clear that if f is uniformly continuous on A, then it is continuous at every point of A.
In general, however, the converse does not hold, as is shown by the function gðxÞ ¼ 1=x on
the set A :¼ fx 2 R : x &gt; 0g.
It is useful to formulate a condition equivalent to saying that f is not uniformly
continuous on A. We give such criteria in the next result, leaving the proof to the reader as
an exercise.
5.4.2 Nonuniform Continuity Criteria Let A # R and let f : A ! R. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

f is not uniformly continuous on A.
There exists an e0 &gt; 0 such that for every d &gt; 0 there are points xd ; ud in A such that
jxd # ud j &lt; d and j f ðxd Þ # f ðud Þj # e0 .
There exists an e0 &gt; 0 and two sequences (xn) and (un) in A such that limðxn #
un Þ ¼ 0 and j f ðxn Þ # f ðun Þj # e0 for all n 2 N.

We can apply this result to show that gðxÞ :¼ 1=x is not uniformly continuous
on A :¼ fx 2 R : x &gt; 0g. For, if xn :¼ 1=n and un :¼ 1=ðn þ 1Þ, then we have
limðxn # un Þ ¼ 0, but jgðxn Þ # gðun Þj ¼ 1 for all n 2 N.
We now present an important result that assures that a continuous function on a closed
bounded interval I is uniformly continuous on I. Other proofs of this theorem are given in
Sections 5.5 and 11.3.

5.4.3 Uniform Continuity Theorem Let I be a closed bounded interval and let
f : I ! R be continuous on I. Then f is uniformly continuous on I.
Proof. If f is not uniformly continuous on I then, by the preceding result, there exists
e0 &gt; 0 and two sequences (xn) and (un) in I such that jxn # un j &lt; 1=n and j f ðxn Þ # f ðun Þj #
e0 for all n 2 N. Since I is bounded, the sequence (xn) is bounded; by the BolzanoWeierstrass Theorem 3.4.8 there is a subsequence ðxnk Þ of (xn) that converges to an element
z. Since I is closed, the limit z belongs to I, by Theorem 3.2.6. It is clear that the
corresponding subsequence ðunk Þ also converges to z, since
junk # zj # junk # xnk j þ jxnk # zj:
Now if f is continuous at the point z, then both of the sequences ð f ðxnk ÞÞ and ð f ðunk ÞÞ
must converge to f ðzÞ. But this is not possible since
j f ðxn Þ # f ðun Þj # e0
for all n 2 N. Thus the hypothesis that f is not uniformly continuous on the closed bounded
interval I implies that f is not continuous at some point z 2 I. Consequently, if f is
continuous at every point of I, then f is uniformly continuous on I.
Q.E.D.
Lipschitz Functions
If a uniformly continuous function is given on a set that is not a closed bounded interval,
then it is sometimes difficult to establish its uniform continuity. However, there is a
condition that frequently occurs that is sufficient to guarantee uniform continuity. It is
named after Rudolf Lipschitz (1832–1903) who was a student of Dirichlet and who worked
extensively in differential equations and Riemannian geometry.
5.4.4 Definition Let A # R and let f : A ! R. If there exists a constant K &gt; 0 such that
ð4Þ

j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj # Kjx # uj

for all x; u 2 A, then f is said to be a Lipschitz function (or to satisfy a Lipschitz
condition) on A.
The condition (4) that a function f : I ! R on an interval I is a Lipschitz function can
be interpreted geometrically as follows. If we write the condition as
f ðxÞ # f ðuÞ
# K;
x#u

x; u 2 I; x 6¼ u ;

then the quantity inside the absolute values is the slope of a line segment joining the points
ðx; f ðxÞÞ and ðu; f ðuÞÞ. Thus a function f satisfies a Lipschitz condition if and only if the
slopes of all line segments joining two points on the graph of y ¼ f ðxÞ over I are bounded
by some number K.
5.4.5 Theorem If f : A ! R is a Lipschitz function, then f is uniformly continuous on A.
Proof. If condition (4) is satisfied, then given e &gt; 0, we can take d :¼ e=K. If x; u 2 A
satisfy jx # uj &lt; d, then
e
j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj &lt; K # ¼ e:
K
Therefore f is uniformly continuous on A.

CHAPTER 5 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

5.4.6 Examples (a) If f ðxÞ :¼ x2 on A :¼ ½0; b#, where b &gt; 0, then
j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj ¼ jx þ ujjx # uj # 2bjx # uj
for all x, u in [0, b]. Thus f satisfies (4) with K :¼ 2b on A, and therefore f is uniformly
continuous on A. Of course, since f is continuous and A is a closed bounded interval, this
can also be deduced from the Uniform Continuity Theorem. (Note that f does not satisfy a
Lipschitz condition on the interval ½0; 1Þ.)
(b) Not every uniformly
continuous function is a Lipschitz function.
pﬃﬃﬃ
Let gðxÞ :¼ x for x in the closed bounded interval I :¼ ½0; 2#. Since g is continuous
on I, it follows from the Uniform Continuity Theorem 5.4.3 that g is uniformly continuous
on I. However, there is no number K &gt; 0 such that jgðxÞj # Kjxj for all x 2 I. (Why not?)
Therefore, g is not a Lipschitz function on I.
(c) The Uniform Continuity Theorem and Theorem 5.4.5 can sometimes be combined to
establish the uniform continuity
pﬃﬃﬃ of a function on a set.
We consider gðxÞ :¼ x on the set A :¼ ½0; 1Þ. The uniform continuity of g on the
interval I :¼ ½0; 2# follows from the Uniform Continuity Theorem as noted in (b). If
J :¼ ½1; 1Þ, then if both x, u are in J, we have
jgðxÞ # gðuÞj ¼

pﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃ
jx # uj
x # u ¼ pﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃ # 12 jx # uj:
xþ u

Thus g is a Lipschitz function on J with constant K ¼ 12, and hence by Theorem 5.4.5, g is
uniformly continuous on [1, 1). Since A ¼ I [ J, it follows [by taking dðeÞ :¼
inf f1; dI ðeÞ; dJ ðeÞg] that g is uniformly continuous on A. We leave the details to the
&amp;
reader.

The Continuous Extension Theorem
We have seen examples of functions that are continuous but not uniformly continuous on
open intervals; for example, the function f ðxÞ ¼ 1=x on the interval (0, 1). On the other
hand, by the Uniform Continuity Theorem, a function that is continuous on a closed
bounded interval is always uniformly continuous. So the question arises: Under what
conditions is a function uniformly continuous on a bounded open interval? The answer
reveals the strength of uniform continuity, for it will be shown that a function on (a, b) is
uniformly continuous if and only if it can be defined at the endpoints to produce a function
that is continuous on the closed interval. We first establish a result that is of interest in itself.
5.4.7 Theorem If f : A ! R is uniformly continuous on a subset A of R and if ðxn Þ is a
Cauchy sequence in A, then ð f ðxn ÞÞ is a Cauchy sequence in R.
Proof. Let (xn) be a Cauchy sequence in A, and let e &gt; 0 be given. First choose d &gt; 0 such
that if x, u in A satisfy jx # uj &lt; d, then j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj &lt; e. Since (xn) is a Cauchy
sequence, there exists HðdÞ such that jxn # xm j &lt; d for all n; m &gt; HðdÞ. By the choice of d,
this implies that for n; m &gt; HðdÞ, we have j f ðxn Þ # f ðxm Þj &lt; e. Therefore the sequence
ð f ðxn ÞÞ is a Cauchy sequence.
Q.E.D.
The preceding result gives us an alternative way of seeing that f ðxÞ :¼ 1=x is not
uniformly continuous on (0, 1). We note that the sequence given by xn :¼ 1=n in (0, 1) is a
Cauchy sequence, but the image sequence, where f ðxn Þ ¼ n, is not a Cauchy sequence.

5.4.8 Continuous Extension Theorem A function f is uniformly continuous on the
interval (a, b) if and only if it can be defined at the endpoints a and b such that the extended function is continuous on [a, b].
Proof. ð(Þ This direction is trivial.
ð)Þ Suppose f is uniformly continuous on (a, b). We shall show how to extend f to a;
the argument for b is similar. This is done by showing that x!c
lim f ðxÞ ¼ L exists, and this is
accomplished by using the sequential criterion for limits. If (xn) is a sequence in (a, b) with
limðxn Þ ¼ a, then it is a Cauchy sequence, and by the preceding theorem, the sequence
ð f ðxn ÞÞ is also a Cauchy sequence, and so is convergent by Theorem 3.5.5. Thus the limit
limð f ðxn ÞÞ ¼ L exists. If (un) is any other sequence in (a, b) that converges to a, then
limðun # xn Þ ¼ a # a ¼ 0, so by the uniform continuity of f we have
limð f ðun ÞÞ ¼ limð f ðun Þ # f ðxn ÞÞ þ limð f ðxn ÞÞ
¼ 0 þ L ¼ L:
Since we get the same value L for every sequence converging to a, we infer from the
sequential criterion for limits that f has limit L at a. If we define f ðaÞ :¼ L, then f is
continuous at a. The same argument applies to b, so we conclude that f has a continuous
extension to the interval [a, b].
Q.E.D.
Since the limit of f ðxÞ :¼ sinð1=xÞ at 0 does not exist, we infer from the Continuous
Extension Theorem that the function is not uniformly continuous on ð0; b# for any b &gt; 0.
On the other hand, since lim x sinð1=xÞ ¼ 0 exists, the function gðxÞ :¼ x sinð1=xÞ is
x!0

uniformly continuous on ð0; b# for all b &gt; 0.
Approximationy
In many applications it is important to be able to approximate continuous functions by
functions of an elementary nature. Although there are a variety of definitions that can be used
to make the word ‘‘approximate’’ more precise, one of the most natural (as well as one of the
most important) is to require that, at every point of the given domain, the approximating
function shall not differ from the given function by more than the preassigned error.
5.4.9 Definition A function s : ½a; b# ! R is called a step function if [a, b] is the union
of a finite number of nonoverlapping intervals I 1 ; I 2 ; . . . ; I n such that s is constant on each
interval, that is, sðxÞ ¼ ck for all x 2 I k ; k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n.
Thus a step function has only a finite number of distinct values.
For example, the function s : ½#2; 4# ! R defined by

We will now show that a continuous function on a closed bounded interval I can be
approximated arbitrarily closely by step functions.
5.4.10 Theorem Let I be a closed bounded interval and let f : I ! R be continuous on I.
If e &gt; 0, then there exists a step function se : I ! R such that j f ðxÞ # se ðxÞj &lt; e for all
x 2 I.
Proof. Since (by the Uniform Continuity Theorem 5.4.3) the function f is uniformly
continuous, it follows that given e &gt; 0 there is a number dðeÞ &gt; 0 such that if x; y 2 I and
jx # yj &lt; dðeÞ, then j f ðxÞ # f ð yÞj &lt; e. Let I :¼ ½a; b# and let m 2 N be sufficiently large so
that h :¼ ðb # aÞ=m &lt; dðeÞ. We now divide I ¼ [a, b] into m disjoint intervals of length h;
namely, I 1 :¼ ½a; a þ h#, and I k :¼ ða þ ðk # 1Þh; a þ khÞ for k ¼ 2, . . . , m. Since the
length of each subinterval Ik is h &lt; dðeÞ, the difference between any two values of f in Ik is
less than e. We now define
ð5Þ

se ðxÞ :¼ f ða þ khÞ for

x 2 Ik;

k ¼ 1; . . . ; m;

so that se is constant on each interval Ik. (In fact the value of se on Ik is the value of f at the
right endpoint of Ik. See Figure 5.4.4.) Consequently if x 2 I k , then
j f ðxÞ # se ðxÞj ¼ j f ðxÞ # f ða þ khÞj &lt; e:
Therefore we have j f ðxÞ # se ðxÞj &lt; e for all x 2 I.

Note that the proof of the preceding theorem establishes somewhat more than was
announced in the statement of the theorem. In fact, we have proved the following, more
precise, assertion.
5.4.11 Corollary Let I :¼ ½a; b# be a closed bounded interval and let f : I ! R be
continuous on I. If e &gt; 0, there exists a natural number m such that if we divide I into m
disjoint intervals Ik having length h :¼ ðb # aÞ=m, then the step function se defined in
equation (5) satisfies j f ðxÞ # se ðxÞj &lt; e for all x 2 I.
Step functions are extremely elementary in character, but they are not continuous
(except in trivial cases). Since it is often desirable to approximate continuous functions by
elementary continuous functions, we now shall show that we can approximate continuous
functions by continuous piecewise linear functions.
5.4.12 Definition Let I :¼ ½a; b# be an interval. Then a function g : I ! R is said to be
piecewise linear on I if I is the union of a finite number of disjoint intervals I 1 ; . . . ; I m ,
such that the restriction of g to each interval Ik is a linear function.
Remark It is evident that in order for a piecewise linear function g to be continuous on
I, the line segments that form the graph of g must meet at the endpoints of adjacent
subintervals I k ; I kþ1 ðk ¼ 1; . . . ; m # 1Þ.
5.4.13 Theorem Let I be a closed bounded interval and let f : I ! R be continuous on I.
If e &gt; 0, then there exists a continuous piecewise linear function ge : I ! R such that
j f ðxÞ # ge ðxÞj &lt; e for all x 2 I.
Proof. Since f is uniformly continuous on I :¼ ½a; b#, there is a number dðeÞ &gt; 0 such that
if x, y 2 I and jx # yj &lt; dðeÞ, then j f ðxÞ # f ðyÞj &lt; e. Let m 2 N be sufficiently large so
that h :¼ ðb # aÞ=m &lt; dðeÞ. Divide I ¼ ½a; b# into m disjoint intervals of length h; namely,
let I 1 ¼ ½a; a þ h#, and let I k ¼ ða þ ðk # 1Þh; a þ kh# for k ¼ 2; . . . ; m. On each interval
Ik we define ge to be the linear function joining the points
ða þ ðk # 1Þh; f ða þ ðk # 1ÞhÞÞ and

ða þ kh; f ða þ khÞÞ :

Then ge is a continuous piecewise linear function on I. Since, for x 2 I k the value f(x) is
within e of f ða þ ðk # 1ÞhÞ and f ða þ khÞ, it is an exercise to show that j f ðxÞ # ge ðxÞj &lt; e
for all x 2 I k ; therefore this inequality holds for all x 2 I. (See Figure 5.4.5.)

CHAPTER 5 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

We shall close this section by stating the important theorem of Weierstrass concerning the approximation of continuous functions by polynomial functions. As would be
expected, in order to obtain an approximation within an arbitrarily preassigned e &gt; 0,
we must be prepared to use polynomials of arbitrarily high degree.
5.4.14 Weierstrass Approximation Theorem Let I ¼ ½a; b# and let f : I ! R be a
continuous function. If e &gt; 0 is given, then there exists a polynomial function pe such that
j f ðxÞ # pe ðxÞj &lt; e for all x 2 I.
There are a number of proofs of this result. Unfortunately, all of them are rather
intricate, or employ results that are not yet at our disposal. (A proof can be found in Bartle,
ERA, pp. 169–172, which is listed in the References.)

on I, then f is absolutely continuous on I.

Section 5.5 Continuity and Gaugesy
We will now introduce some concepts that will be used later—especially in Chapters 7 and
10 on integration theory. However, we wish to introduce the notion of a ‘‘gauge’’ now
because of its connection with the study of continuous functions. We first define the notion
of a tagged partition of an interval.
5.5.1 Definition A partition of an interval I :¼ ½a; b# is a collection P ¼ fI 1 ; . . . ; I n g of
non-overlapping closed intervals whose union is [a, b]. We ordinarily denote the intervals
by I i :¼ ½xi#1 ; xi #, where
a ¼ x0 &lt; # # # &lt; xi#1 &lt; xi &lt; # # # &lt; xn ¼ b:
The points xi ði ¼ 0; . . . ; nÞ are called the partition points of P. If a point ti has been
chosen from each interval Ii, for i ¼ 1, . . . , n, then the points ti are called the tags and the
set of ordered pairs
#
P ¼ fðI 1 ; t1 Þ; . . . ; ðI n ; tn Þg
is called a tagged partition of I. (The dot signifies that the partition is tagged.)
The ‘‘fineness’’ of a partition P refers to the lengths of the subintervals in P. Instead of
requiring that all subintervals have length less than some specific quantity, it is often useful
to allow varying degrees of fineness for different subintervals Ii in P. This is accomplished
by the use of a ‘‘gauge,’’ which we now define.
5.5.2 Definition A gauge on I is a strictly positive function defined on I. If d is a gauge on
I, then a (tagged) partition P_ is said to be d-fine if
ð1Þ

ti 2 I i # ½ti # dðti Þ; ti þ dðti Þ# for

i ¼ 1; . . . ; n :

We note that the notion of d-fineness requires that the partition be tagged, so we do not
need to say ‘‘tagged partition’’ in this case.
A gauge d on an interval I assigns an interval ½t # dðtÞ; t þ dðtÞ# to each point t 2 I. The
d-fineness of a partition P_ requires that each subinterval Ii of P_ is contained in the interval
determined by the gauge d and the tag ti for that subinterval. This is indicated by the
inclusions in (1); see Figure 5.5.1. Note that the length of the subintervals is also controlled
by the gauge and the tags; the next lemma reflects that control.

5.5.3 Lemma If a partition P_ of I :¼ ½a; b# is d-fine and x 2 I, then there exists a tag ti
in P_ such that jx # ti j # dðti Þ.
Proof. If x 2 I, there exists a subinterval ½xi#1 ; xi # from P_ that contains x. Since P_ is
d-fine, then
ti # dðti Þ # xi#1 # x # xi # ti þ dðti Þ;

ð2Þ

whence it follows that jx # ti j # dðti Þ.

Q.E.D.

In the theory of Riemann integration, we will use gauges d that are constant
functions to control the fineness of the partition; in the theory of the generalized
Riemann integral, the use of nonconstant gauges is essential. But nonconstant gauge
functions arise quite naturally in connection with continuous functions. For, let f : I !
R be continuous on I and let e &gt; 0 be given. Then, for each point t 2 I there
exists de ðtÞ &gt; 0 such that if jx # tj &lt; de ðtÞ and x 2 I, then j f ðxÞ # f ðtÞj &lt; e. Since de
is defined and is strictly positive on I, the function de is a gauge on I. Later in this
section, we will use the relations between gauges and continuity to give alternative
proofs of the fundamental properties of continuous functions discussed in Sections 5.3
and 5.4.
5.5.4 Examples (a) If d and g are gauges on I :¼ ½a; b# and if 0 &lt; dðxÞ # g ðxÞ for all
x 2 I, then every partition P_ that is d-fine is also g-fine. This follows immediately from the
inequalities
ti # gðti Þ # ti # dðti Þ and

ti þ dðti Þ # ti þ gðti Þ

which imply that
ti 2 ½ti # dðti Þ; ti þ dðti Þ# # ½ti # gðti Þ; ti þ gðti Þ# for

i ¼ 1; . . . ; n :

(b) If d1 and d2 are gauges on I :¼ ½a; b# and if
dðxÞ :¼ minfd1 ðxÞ; d2 ðxÞg for all

x2I;

then d is also a gauge on I. Moreover, since dðxÞ # d1 ðxÞ, then every d-fine partition is d1 fine. Similarly, every d-fine partition is also d2 -fine.
(c) Suppose that d is defined on I :¼ ½0; 1# by
(
dðxÞ :¼

Then d is a gauge on [0, 1]. If 0 &lt; t # 1, then ½t # dðtÞ; t þ dðtÞ# ¼ 12 t; 32 t , which does not
contain the point 0. Thus, if P_ is a d-fine partition of I, then the only subinterval in P_ that
contains 0 must have the point 0 as its tag.

&amp;

Existence of d-Fine Partitions
In view of the above examples, it is not obvious that an arbitrary gauge d admits a d-fine
partition. We now use the Supremum Property of R to establish the existence of d-fine
partitions. In the exercises, we will sketch a proof based on the Nested Intervals
Theorem 2.5.2.
5.5.5 Theorem If d is a gauge defined on the interval [a, b], then there exists a d-fine
partition of [a, b].
Proof. Let E denote the set of all points x 2 ½a; b# such that there exists a d-fine partition
of the subinterval [a, x]. The set E is not empty, since the pair ([a, x], a) is a d-fine
partition of the interval [a, x] when x 2 ½a; a þ dðaÞ# and x # b. Since E # ½a; b#, the set
E is also bounded. Let u :¼ sup E so that a &lt; u # b. We will show that u 2 E and that
u ¼ b.
We claim that u 2 E. Since u # dðuÞ &lt; u ¼ sup E, there exists v 2 E such that
u # dðuÞ &lt; v &lt; u. Let P_ 1 be a d-fine partition of [a, v] and let P_ 2 :¼ P_ 1 [ ð½v; u#; uÞ.
Then P_ 2 is a d-fine partition of [a, u], so that u 2 E.
_ 1 is a d-fine partition of
If u &lt; b, let w 2 ½a; b# be such that u &lt; w &lt; u þ dðuÞ. If Q
_
_
_
[a, u], we let Q2 :¼ Q1 [ ð½u; w#; uÞ. Then Q2 is a d-fine partition of [a, w], whence
w 2 E. But this contradicts the supposition that u is an upper bound of E. Therefore
u ¼ b.
Q.E.D.

Some Applications
Following R. A. Gordon (see his Monthly article in the References), we will now show that
some of the major theorems in the two preceding sections can be proved by using gauges.
Alternate Proof of Theorem 5.3.2: Boundedness Theorem. Since f is continuous on I,
then for each t 2 I there exists dðtÞ &gt; 0 such that if x 2 I and jx # tj # dðtÞ, then
j f ðxÞ # f ðtÞj # 1. Thus d is a gauge on I. Let fðI i ; ti Þgni¼1 be a d-fine partition of I and
let K :¼ maxfj f ðti Þj : i ¼ 1; . . . ; ng. By Lemma 5.5.3, given any x 2 I there exists i with
jx # ti j # dðti Þ, whence
j f ðxÞj # j f ðxÞ # f ðti Þj þ j f ðti Þj # 1 þ K:
Since x 2 I is arbitrary, then f is bounded by 1 þ K on I.

CHAPTER 5 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

Alternate Proof of Theorem 5.3.4: Maximum-Minimum Theorem. We will prove the
existence of x . Let M :¼ supff ðxÞ : x 2 I g and suppose that f(x) &lt; M for all x 2 I. Since f
is continuous on I, for each t 2 I there exists dðtÞ &gt; 0 such that if x 2 I and jx # tj # dðtÞ,
then f ðxÞ &lt; 12 ðM þ f ðtÞÞ. Thus d is a gauge on I, and if fðI i ; ti Þgni¼1 is a d-fine partition of I,
we let
~
M :¼ 12 maxfM þ f ðt1 Þ; . . . ; M þ f ðtn Þg:
By Lemma 5.5.3, given any x 2 I, there exists i with jx # ti j # dðti Þ, whence
~
f ðxÞ &lt; 12 ðM þ f ðti ÞÞ # M:
~
Since x 2 I is arbitrary, then Mð&lt; MÞ is an upper bound for f on I, contrary to the definition
of M as the supremum of f.
Q.E.D.
Alternate Proof of Theorem 5.3.5: Location of Roots Theorem. We assume that f ðtÞ 6¼ 0
for all t 2 I. Since f is continuous at t, Exercise 5.1.7 implies that there exists dðtÞ &gt; 0 such
that if x 2 I and jx # tj # dðtÞ, then f (x) &lt; 0 if f (t) &lt; 0, and f (x) &gt; 0 if f (t) &gt; 0. Then d is
a gauge on I and we let fðI i ; ti Þgni¼1 be a d-fine partition. Note that for each i, either f (x) &lt; 0
for all x 2 ½xi#1 ; xi # or f (x) &gt; 0 for all such x. Since f ðx0 Þ ¼ f ðaÞ &lt; 0, this implies that
f (x1) &lt; 0, which in turn implies that f (x2) &lt; 0. Continuing in this way, we have
f ðbÞ ¼ f ðxn Þ &lt; 0, contrary to the hypothesis that f (b) &gt; 0.
Q.E.D.
Alternate Proof of Theorem 5.4.3: Uniform Continuity Theorem. Let e &gt; 0 be given.
Since f is continuous at t 2 I, there exists dðtÞ &gt; 0 such that if x 2 I and jx # tj # 2dðtÞ,
then j f ðxÞ # f ðtÞj # 12 e. Thus d is a gauge on I. If fðI i ; ti Þgni¼1 is a d-fine partition of I,
let de :¼ minfdðt1 Þ; . . . ; dðtn Þg. Now suppose that x; u 2 I and jx # uj # de , and choose i
with jx # ti j # dðti Þ. Since
ju # ti j # ju # xj þ jx # ti j # de þ dðti Þ # 2dðti Þ;
then it follows that
j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj # j f ðxÞ # f ðti Þj þ j f ðti Þ # f ðuÞj # 12 e þ 12 e ¼ e:
Therefore, f is uniformly continuous on I.

Section 5.6 Monotone and Inverse Functions
Recall that if A # R, then a function f : A ! R is said to be increasing on A if whenever
x1 ; x2 2 A and x1 # x2 , then f ðx1 Þ # f ðx2 Þ. The function f is said to be strictly increasing
on A if whenever x1 ;x2 2 A and x1 &lt; x2 , then f ðx1 Þ &lt; f ðx2 Þ. Similarly, g : A ! R is said
to be decreasing on A if whenever x1 ; x2 2 A and x1 # x2 then gðx1 Þ # gðx2 Þ. The
function g is said to be strictly decreasing on A if whenever x1 ; x2 2 A and x1 &lt; x2 then
gðx1 Þ &gt; gðx2 Þ.
If a function is either increasing or decreasing on A, we say that it is monotone on A.
If f is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on A, we say that f is strictly
monotone on A.
We note that if f : A ! R is increasing on A then g :¼ #f is decreasing on A; similarly
if w : A ! R is decreasing on A then c :¼ #w is increasing on A.

CHAPTER 5 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

In this section, we will be concerned with monotone functions that are defined on
an interval I # R. We will discuss increasing functions explicitly, but it is clear that
there are corresponding results for decreasing functions. These results can either be
obtained directly from the results for increasing functions or proved by similar
arguments.
Monotone functions are not necessarily continuous. For example, if f ðxÞ :¼ 0 for
x 2 ½0; 1# and f ðxÞ :¼ 1 for x 2 ð1; 2#, then f is increasing on [0, 2], but fails to be
continuous at x ¼ 1. However, the next result shows that a monotone function always has
both one-sided limits (see Definition 4.3.1) in R at every point that is not an endpoint of its
domain.
5.6.1 Theorem Let I # R be an interval and let f : I ! R be increasing on I. Suppose
that c 2 I is not an endpoint of I. Then
(i)
(ii)

lim f ¼ supf f ðxÞ : x 2 I; x &lt; cg,

x!c#

lim f ¼ inf f f ðxÞ : x 2 I; x &gt; cg.

x!cþ

Proof. (i) First note that if x 2 I and x &lt; c, then f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ. Hence the set
f f ðxÞ : x 2 I; x &lt; cg, which is nonvoid since c is not an endpoint of I, is bounded above
by f (c). Thus the indicated supremum exists; we denote it by L. If e &gt; 0 is given, then L # e
is not an upper bound of this set. Hence there exists ye 2 I; ye &lt; c such that
L # e &lt; f ðye Þ # L.
Since f is increasing, we deduce that if de :¼ c # ye and if 0 &lt; c # y &lt; de , then ye &lt;
y &lt; c so that
L # e &lt; f ðye Þ # f ðyÞ # L:
Therefore j f ðyÞ # Lj &lt; e when 0 &lt; c # y &lt; de . Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary we infer that (i)
holds.
The proof of (ii) is similar.
Q.E.D.
The next result gives criteria for the continuity of an increasing function f at a point c
that is not an endpoint of the interval on which f is defined.
5.6.2 Corollary Let I # R be an interval and let f : I ! R be increasing on I. Suppose
that c 2 I is not an endpoint of I. Then the following statements are equivalent.
(a) f is continuous at c.
(b) lim f ¼ f ðcÞ ¼ lim f .
x!c#

x!cþ

(c) supf f ðxÞ : x 2 I; x &lt; cg ¼ f ðcÞ ¼ inf f f ðxÞ : x 2 I; x &gt; cg.
This follows easily from Theorems 4.3.3 and 5.6.1. We leave the details to the
reader.
Let I be an interval and let f : I ! R be an increasing function. If a is the left endpoint
of I, it is an exercise to show that f is continuous at a if and only if
f ðaÞ ¼ inf f f ðxÞ : x 2 I; a &lt; xg
or if and only if f ðaÞ ¼ lim f . Similar conditions apply at a right endpoint, and for
x!aþ
decreasing functions.

The jump of f at c

If f : I ! R is increasing on I and if c is not an endpoint of I, we define the jump of f

that
j f ðcÞ ¼ inf f f ðxÞ : x 2 I; x &gt; cg # supf f ðxÞ : x 2 I; x &lt; cg

a to be j f ðaÞ :¼ lim f # f ðaÞ. If the right endpoint b of I belongs to I, we define the jump

5.6.3 Theorem Let I # R be an interval and let f : I ! R be increasing on I. If c 2 I,
then f is continuous at c if and only if j f ðcÞ ¼ 0.
Proof. If c is not an endpoint, this follows immediately from Corollary 5.6.2. If c 2 I is
the left endpoint of I, then f is continuous at c if and only if f ðcÞ ¼ lim f , which is
x!cþ
equivalent to j f ðcÞ ¼ 0. Similar remarks apply to the case of a right endpoint.
Q.E.D.
We now show that there can be at most a countable set of points at which a monotone
function is discontinuous.
5.6.4 Theorem Let I # R be an interval and let f : I ! R be monotone on I. Then the
set of points D # I at which f is discontinuous is a countable set.
Proof. We shall suppose that f is increasing on I. It follows from Theorem 5.6.3 that
D ¼ x 2 I : j f ð xÞ 6¼ 0 . We shall consider the case that I :¼ ½a; b# is a closed bounded
interval, leaving the case of an arbitrary interval to the reader.
We first note that since f is increasing, then j f ðcÞ # 0 for all c 2 I. Moreover, if
a # x1 &lt; # # # xn # b, then (why?) we have
ð1Þ

f ðaÞ # f ðaÞ þ j f ðx1 Þ þ # # # þ j f ðxn Þ # f ðbÞ;

whence it follows that
j f ðx1 Þ þ # # # þ j f ðxn Þ # f ðbÞ # f ðaÞ:
(See Figure 5.6.2.) Consequently there can be at most k points in I ¼ ½a; b# where
j f ðxÞ # ð f ðbÞ # f ðaÞÞ=k. We conclude that there is at most one point x 2 I where
j f ðxÞ ¼ f ðbÞ # f ðaÞ; there are at most two points in I where j f ðxÞ # ð f ðbÞ # f ðaÞÞ=2;
at most three points in I where j f ðxÞ # ð f ðbÞ # f ðaÞÞ=3, and so on. Therefore there is at

most a countable set of points x where j f ðxÞ &gt; 0. But since every point in D must be
included in this set, we deduce that D is a countable set.
Q.E.D.
Theorem 5.6.4 has some useful applications. For example, it was seen in Exercise
5.2.12 that if h : R ! R satisfies the identity
ð2Þ

hðx þ yÞ ¼ hðxÞ þ hðyÞ

for all

x; y 2 R ;

and if h is continuous at a single point x0, then h is continuous at every point of R. Thus, if h
is a monotone function satisfying (2), then h must be continuous on R. [It follows from this
that h(x) ¼ Cx for all x 2 R, where C :¼ hð1Þ.]
Inverse Functions
We shall now consider the existence of inverses for functions that are continuous on an
interval I # R. We recall (see Section 1.1) that a function f : I ! R has an inverse function
if and only if f is injective (¼ one-one); that is, x; y 2 I and x 6¼ y imply that f ðxÞ 6¼ f ðyÞ.
We note that a strictly monotone function is injective and so has an inverse. In the next
theorem, we show that if f : I ! R is a strictly monotone continuous function, then f
has an inverse function g on J :¼ f ðIÞ that is strictly monotone and continuous on J. In
particular, if f is strictly increasing then so is g, and if f is strictly decreasing then so is g.
5.6.5 Continuous Inverse Theorem Let I # R be an interval and let f : I ! R be
strictly monotone and continuous on I. Then the function g inverse to f is strictly monotone
and continuous on J :¼ f ðIÞ.
Proof. We consider the case that f is strictly increasing, leaving the case that f is strictly
decreasing to the reader.
Since f is continuous and I is an interval, it follows from the Preservation of Intervals
Theorem 5.3.10 that J :¼ f ðIÞ is an interval. Moreover, since f is strictly increasing on I, it
is injective on I; therefore the function g : J ! R inverse to f exists. We claim that g is

strictly increasing. Indeed, if y1 ; y2 2 J with y1 &lt; y2 , then y1 ¼ f ðx1 Þ and y2 ¼ f ðx2 Þ for
some x1 ; x2 2 I. We must have x1 &lt; x2 ; otherwise x1 # x2 , which implies that
y1 ¼ f ðx1 Þ # f ðx2 Þ ¼ y2 , contrary to the hypothesis that y1 &lt; y2 . Therefore we have
gðy1 Þ ¼ x1 &lt; x2 ¼ gðy2 Þ. Since y1 and y2 are arbitrary elements of J with y1 &lt; y2 , we
conclude that g is strictly increasing on J.
It remains to show that g is continuous on J. However, this is a consequence of the fact
that gðJÞ ¼ I is an interval. Indeed, if g is discontinuous at a point c 2 J, then the jump of g
at c is nonzero so that lim g &lt; lim g. If we choose any number x 6¼ gðcÞ satisfying
y!c#

y!cþ

lim g &lt; x &lt; lim g, then x has the property that x 6¼ gðyÞ for any y 2 J. (See
x!c#
x!cþ
Figure 5.6.3.) Hence x 2
= I, which contradicts the fact that I is an interval. Therefore
we conclude that g is continuous on J.
Q.E.D.

The nth Root Function
We will apply the Continuous Inverse Theorem 5.6.5 to the nth power function. We need to
distinguish two cases: (i) n even, and (ii) n odd.
(i) n even. In order to obtain a function that is strictly monotone, we restrict our
attention to the interval I :¼ ½0; 1Þ. Thus, let f ðxÞ :¼ xn for x 2 I. (See Figure 5.6.4.) We
have seen (in Exercise 2.1.23) that if 0 # x &lt; y, then f ðxÞ ¼ xn &lt; yn ¼ f ðyÞ; therefore f is
strictly increasing on I. Moreover, it follows from Example 5.2.3(a) that f is continuous on
I. Therefore, by the Preservation of Intervals Theorem 5.3.10, J :¼ f ðIÞ is an interval.
We will show that J ¼ ½0; 1Þ. Let y # 0 be arbitrary; by the Archimedean Property, there
exists k 2 N such that 0 # y &lt; k. Since
f ð0Þ ¼ 0 # y &lt; k # kn ¼ f ðkÞ;
it follows from Bolzano’s Intermediate Value Theorem 5.3.7 that y 2 J. Since y # 0 is
arbitrary, we deduce that J ¼ ½0; 1Þ.
We conclude from the Continuous Inverse Theorem 5.6.5 that the function g that is
inverse to f ðxÞ ¼ xn on I ¼ ½0; 1Þ is strictly increasing and continuous on J ¼ ½0; 1Þ. We
usually write
pﬃﬃﬃ
gðxÞ ¼ x1=n or gðxÞ ¼ n x

Since g is inverse to f we have
gð f ðxÞÞ ¼ x

f ðgðxÞÞ ¼ x

for all x 2 ½0; 1Þ:

We can write these equations in the following form:

and

ðx1=n Þn ¼ x

for all x 2 ½0; 1Þ and n even.
(ii) n odd. In this case we let FðxÞ :¼ xn for all x 2 R; by 5.2.3(a), F is continuous
on R. We leave it to the reader to show that F is strictly increasing on R and that FðRÞ ¼ R.
(See Figure 5.6.6.)
It follows from the Continuous Inverse Theorem 5.6.5 that the function G that is
inverse to FðxÞ ¼ xn for x 2 R, is strictly increasing and continuous on R. We usually
write
pﬃﬃﬃ
GðxÞ ¼ x1=n or GðxÞ ¼ n x for x 2 R; n odd;
and call x1=n the nth root of x 2 R. The function G is called the nth root function (n odd).

CHAPTER 6

DIFFERENTIATION

Prior to the seventeenth century, a curve was generally described as a locus of points
satisfying some geometric condition, and tangent lines were obtained through geometric
construction. This viewpoint changed dramatically with the creation of analytic geometry in
the 1630s by Ren#e Descartes (1596–1650) and Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). In this new
setting geometric problems were recast in terms of algebraic expressions, and new classes of
curves were defined by algebraic rather than geometric conditions. The concept of derivative
evolved in this new context. The problem of finding tangent lines and the seemingly unrelated
problem of finding maximum or minimum values were first seen to have a connection by
Fermat in the 1630s. And the relation between tangent lines to curves and the velocity of a
moving particle was discovered in the late 1660s by Isaac Newton. Newton’s theory of
‘‘fluxions,’’ which was based on an intuitive idea of limit, would be familiar to any modern
student of differential calculus once some changes in terminology and notation were made.
But the vital observation, made by Newton and, independently, by Gottfried Leibniz in the
1680s, was that areas under curves could be calculated by reversing the differentiation
process. This exciting technique, one that solved previously difficult area problems with ease,
sparked enormous interest among the mathematicians of the era and led to a coherent theory
that became known as the differential and integral calculus.

Isaac Newton
Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was born in Woolsthorpe, in Lincolnshire,
England, on Christmas Day; his father, a farmer, had died three months
earlier. His mother remarried when he was three years old and he was sent
to live with his grandmother. He returned to his mother at age eleven, only
to be sent to boarding school in Grantham the next year. Fortunately, a
perceptive teacher noticed his mathematical talent and, in 1661, Newton
entered Trinity College at Cambridge University, where he studied with
Isaac Barrow.
When the bubonic plague struck in 1665–1666, leaving dead nearly
70,000 persons in London, the university closed and Newton spent two
years back in Woolsthorpe. It was during this period that he formulated his
basic ideas concerning optics, gravitation, and his method of ‘‘fluxions,’’ later called ‘‘calculus.’’
He returned to Cambridge in 1667 and was appointed Lucasian Professor in 1669. His theories of
universal gravitation and planetary motion were published to world acclaim in 1687 under the title
Philosophies Naturalis Principia Mathematica. However, he neglected to publish his method of
inverse tangents for finding areas and other work in calculus, and this led to a controversy over
priority with Leibniz.
Following an illness, he retired from Cambridge University and in 1696 was appointed
Warden of the British mint. However, he maintained contact with advances in science and
mathematics and served as President of the Royal Society from 1703 until his death in 1727. At
his funeral, Newton was eulogized as ‘‘the greatest genius that ever existed.’’ His place of burial in
Westminster Abbey is a popular tourist site.

CHAPTER 6 DIFFERENTIATION

In this chapter we will develop the theory of differentiation. Integration theory,
including the fundamental theorem that relates differentiation and integration, will be the
subject of the next chapter. We will assume that the reader is already familiar with the
geometrical and physical interpretations of the derivative of a function as described in
introductory calculus courses. Consequently, we will concentrate on the mathematical
aspects of the derivative and not go into its applications in geometry, physics, economics,
and so on.
The first section is devoted to a presentation of the basic results concerning the
differentiation of functions. In Section 6.2 we discuss the fundamental Mean Value
Theorem and some of its applications. In Section 6.3 the important L’Hospital Rules
are presented for the calculation of certain types of ‘‘indeterminate’’ limits.
In Section 6.4 we give a brief discussion of Taylor’s Theorem and a few of its
applications—for example, to convex functions and to Newton’s Method for the location
of roots.

Section 6.1 The Derivative
In this section we will present some of the elementary properties of the derivative. We
begin with the definition of the derivative of a function.
6.1.1 Definition Let I # R be an interval, let f : I ! R, and let c 2 I. We say that a real
number L is the derivative of f at c if given any e &gt; 0 there exists dðeÞ &gt; 0 such that if x 2 I
satisfies 0 &lt; jx # cj &lt; dðeÞ, then
#
#
# f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ
#
#
# &lt; e:
ð1Þ
#
L
# x#c
#
In this case we say that f is differentiable at c, and we write f 0 ðcÞ for L.
In other words, the derivative of f at c is given by the limit
f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ
x!c
x#c

f 0 ðcÞ ¼ lim

ð2Þ

provided this limit exists. (We allow the possibility that c may be the endpoint of the
interval.)
Note It is possible to define the derivative of a function having a domain more general
than an interval (since the point c need only be an element of the domain and also a cluster
point of the domain) but the significance of the concept is most naturally apparent for
functions defined on intervals. Consequently we shall limit our attention to such functions.
Whenever the derivative of f : I ! R exists at a point c 2 I, its value is denoted by
f 0 ðcÞ. In this way we obtain a function f 0 whose domain is a subset of the domain of f. In
working with the function f 0 , it is convenient to regard it also as a function of x. For
example, if f ðxÞ :¼ x2 for x 2 R, then at any c in R we have
f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ
x2 # c2
¼ lim
¼ lim ðx þ cÞ ¼ 2c:
x!c
x!c x # c
x!c
x#c

f 0 ðcÞ ¼ lim

Thus, in this case, the function f 0 is defined on all of R and f 0 ðxÞ ¼ 2x for x 2 R .

6.1 THE DERIVATIVE

We now show that continuity of f at a point c is a necessary (but not sufficient)
condition for the existence of the derivative at c.
6.1.2 Theorem If f : I ! R has a derivative at c 2 I, then f is continuous at c.
Proof. For all x 2 I; x 6¼ c, we have
f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ ¼

#
#
f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ
ðx # cÞ:
x#c

Since f 0 ðcÞ exists, we may apply Theorem 4.2.4 concerning the limit of a product to
conclude that
#
#
#
f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ #
lim ð f ðxÞ # f ðcÞÞ ¼ lim
lim ðx # cÞ
x!c
x!c
x!c
x#c
¼ f 0 ðcÞ # 0 ¼ 0:
Therefore, lim f ðxÞ ¼ f ðcÞ so that f is continuous at c.
x!c

Q.E.D.

The continuity of f : I ! R at a point does not assure the existence of the derivative at
that point. For example, if f ðxÞ :¼ jxj for x 2 R, then for x 6¼ 0 we have
ð f ðxÞ # f ð0ÞÞ=ðx # 0Þ ¼ jxj=x, which is equal to 1 if x &gt; 0, and equal to #1 if x &lt; 0.
Thus the limit at 0 does not exist [see Example 4.1.10(b)], and therefore the function is not
differentiable at 0. Hence, continuity at a point c is not a sufficient condition for the
derivative to exist at c.
Remark By taking simple algebraic combinations of functions of the form x 7! jx # cj,
it is not difficult to construct continuous functions that do not have a derivative at a finite (or
even a countable) number of points. In 1872, Karl Weierstrass astounded the mathematical
world by giving an example of a function that is continuous at every point but whose
derivative does not exist anywhere. Such a function defied geometric intuition about
curves and tangent lines, and consequently spurred much deeper investigations into the
concepts of real analysis. It can be shown that the function f defined by the series
f ðxÞ :¼

1
X

n
n cos ð3 xÞ

n¼0

has the stated property. A very interesting historical discussion of this and other examples
of continuous, nondifferentiable functions is given in Kline, pp. 955–966, and also in
Hawkins, pp. 44–46. A detailed proof for a slightly different example can be found in
Appendix E.
There are a number of basic properties of the derivative that are very useful in the
calculation of the derivatives of various combinations of functions. We now provide the
justification of some of these properties, which will be familiar to the reader from earlier
courses.
6.1.3 Theorem Let I # R be an interval, let c 2 I, and let f : I ! R and g : I ! R be
functions that are differentiable at c. Then:

Theorem 6.1.2). Therefore, since gðcÞ 6¼ 0, we know from Theorem 4.2.9 that there exists an
interval J # I with c 2 J such that gðxÞ 6¼ 0 for all x 2 J. For x 2 J; x 6¼ c, we have

An important special case of the extended product rule (8) occurs if the functions are
equal, that is, f 1 ¼ f 2 ¼ # # # ¼ f n ¼ f . Then (8) becomes
ð f n Þ0 ðcÞ ¼ nð f ðcÞÞn#1 f 0 ðcÞ:

ð9Þ

In particular, if we take f ðxÞ :¼ x, then we find the derivative of gðxÞ :¼ xn to be
g0 ðxÞ ¼ nxn#1; n 2 N. The formula is extended to include negative integers by applying
the Quotient Rule 6.1.3(d).
Notation If I # R is an interval and f : I ! R, we have introduced the notation f 0 to
denote the function whose domain is a subset of I and whose value at a point c is the derivative
f 0 ðcÞ of f at c. There are other notations that are sometimes used for f 0; for example, one
sometimes writes Df for f 0. Thus one can write formulas (4) and (5) in the form:
Dð f þ gÞ ¼ Df þ Dg;

Dð f gÞ ¼ ðDf Þ # g þ f # ðDgÞ:

When x is the ‘‘independent variable,’’ it is common practice in elementary courses to write
df =dx for f 0. Thus formula (5) is sometimes written in the form
#
#

ðxÞ :

This last notation, due to Leibniz, has certain advantages. However, it also has certain
disadvantages and must be used with some care.
The Chain Rule
We now turn to the theorem on the differentiation of composite functions known as the
‘‘Chain Rule.’’ It provides a formula for finding the derivative of a composite function
g # f in terms of the derivatives of g and f.
We first establish the following theorem concerning the derivative of a function at a
point that gives us a very nice method for proving the Chain Rule. It will also be used to
derive the formula for differentiating inverse functions.
6.1.5 Carath#eodory’s Theorem Let f be defined on an interval I containing the point c.
Then f is differentiable at c if and only if there exists a function w on I that is continuous at
c and satisfies
ð10Þ

f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ ¼ wðxÞðx # cÞ

f or

x 2 I:

0

In this case, we have wðcÞ ¼ f ðcÞ.
Proof. ð)Þ If f 0 ðcÞ exists, we can define w by

for
wðxÞ :¼
x#c

f ð cÞ
for

x 6¼ c; x 2 I;
x ¼ c:

The continuity of w follows from the fact that lim wðxÞ ¼ f 0 ðcÞ. If x ¼ c, then both sides of
x!c

(10) equal 0, while if x 6¼ c, then multiplication of wðxÞ by x # c gives (10) for all other x 2 I.

ð(Þ Now assume that a function w that is continuous at c and satisfying (10) exists. If
we divide (10) by x # c 6¼ 0, then the continuity of w implies that
wðcÞ ¼ lim wðxÞ ¼ lim
x!c

exists. Therefore f is differentiable at c and f 0 ðcÞ ¼ wðcÞ.

Q.E.D.

To illustrate Carath#eodory’s Theorem, we consider the function f defined by f ðxÞ :¼ x3
for x 2 R. For c 2 R, we see from the factorization
x3 # c3 ¼ x2 þ cx þ c2 ðx # cÞ
that wðxÞ :¼ x2 þ cx þ c2 satisfies the conditions of the theorem. Therefore, we conclude
that f is differentiable at c 2 R and that f 0 ðcÞ ¼ wðcÞ ¼ 3c2 .
We will now establish the Chain Rule. If f is differentiable at c and g is differentiable at
f (c), then the Chain Rule states that the derivative of the composite function g # f at c is the
product ðg # f Þ0 ðcÞ ¼ g0 ð f ðcÞÞ # f 0 ðcÞ. Note that this can be written as
ð g # f Þ 0 ¼ ð g0 # f Þ # f 0 :
One approach to the Chain Rule is the observation that the difference quotient can be
written, when f ðxÞ 6¼ f ðcÞ, as the product
gð f ðxÞÞ # gð f ðcÞÞ gð f ðxÞÞ # gð f ðcÞÞ f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ
¼
#
:
x#c
f ð x Þ # f ð cÞ
x#c
This suggests the correct limiting value. Unfortunately, the first factor in the product on the
right is undefined if the denominator f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ equals 0 for values of x near c, and this
presents a problem. However, the use of Carath#eodory’s Theorem neatly avoids this
difficulty.
6.1.6 Chain Rule Let I, J be intervals in R, let g : I ! R and f : J ! R be functions
such that f ðJ Þ # I, and let c 2 J. If f is differentiable at c and if g is differentiable at f (c),
then the composite function g # f is differentiable at c and
ð11Þ

ðg # f Þ0 ðcÞ ¼ g0 ð f ðcÞÞ # f 0 ðcÞ:

Proof. Since f 0 ðcÞ exists, Carath#eodory’s Theorem 6.1.5 implies that there exists a
function w on J such that w is continuous at c and f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ ¼ wðxÞðx # cÞ for
x 2 J, and where wðcÞ ¼ f 0 ðcÞ. Also, since g0 ð f ðcÞÞ exists, there is a function c defined
on I such that c is continuous at d :¼ f ðcÞ and gðyÞ # gðd Þ ¼ cðyÞðy # d Þ for y 2 I, where
cðd Þ ¼ g0 ðd Þ. Substitution of y ¼ f ðxÞ and d ¼ f ðcÞ then produces
gð f ðxÞÞ # gð f ðcÞÞ ¼ cð f ðxÞÞð f ðxÞ # f ðcÞÞ ¼ ½ðc # f ðxÞÞ # wðxÞ#ðx # cÞ
for all x 2 J such that f ðxÞ 2 I. Since the function ðc # f Þ # w is continuous at c and its
value at c is g0 ð f ðcÞÞ # f 0 ðcÞ, Carath#eodory’s Theorem gives (11).
Q.E.D.
If g is differentiable on I, if f is differentiable on J, and if f ðJ Þ # I, then it follows from
the Chain Rule that ðg # f Þ0 ¼ ðg0 # f Þ # f 0 , which can also be written in the form
Dðg # f Þ ¼ ðDg # f Þ # Df .

6.1.7 Examples (a) If f : I ! R is differentiable on I and gðyÞ :¼ yn for y 2 R and

Therefore we have ð f n Þ0 ðxÞ ¼ nð f ðxÞÞn#1 f 0 ðxÞ for all x 2 I as was seen in (9).
(b) Suppose that f : I ! R is differentiable on I and that f ðxÞ 6¼ 0 and f 0 ðxÞ 6¼ 0 for x 2 I.
If hðyÞ :¼ 1=y for y 6¼ 0, then it is an exercise to show that h0 ðyÞ ¼ #1=y2 for y 2 R; y 6¼ 0.

g0 ðxÞ ¼ sgnðxÞ for x 6¼ 0. (The signum function is defined in Example 4.1.10(b).) Though
sgn is defined everywhere, it is not equal to g0 at x ¼ 0 since g0 ð0Þ does not exist.
Now if f is a differentiable function, then the Chain Rule implies that the function
g # f ¼ j f j is also differentiable at all points x where f ðxÞ 6¼ 0, and its derivative is
given by

If f is differentiable at a point c with f ðcÞ ¼ 0, then it is an exercise to show that j f j is
differentiable at c if and only if f 0 ðcÞ ¼ 0. (See Exercise 7.)

For example,

If we use the fact that D sin x ¼ cos x for all x 2 R and apply the Product Rule 6.1.3(c) and
the Chain Rule 6.1.6, we obtain (why?)
f 0 ðxÞ ¼ 2x sin ð1=xÞ # cos ð1=xÞ for

x 6¼ 0:

If x ¼ 0, none of the calculational rules may be applied. (Why?) Consequently, the
derivative of f at x ¼ 0 must be found by applying the definition of derivative. We find that
f ðxÞ # f ð0Þ
x2 sin ð1=xÞ

f 0 ð0Þ ¼ lim

Hence, the derivative f 0 of f exists at all x 2 R. However, the function f 0 does not have a
limit at x ¼ 0 (why?), and consequently f 0 is discontinuous at x ¼ 0. Thus, a function f that
&amp;
is differentiable at every point of R need not have a continuous derivative f 0.
Inverse Functions
We will now relate the derivative of a function to the derivative of its inverse function, when
this inverse function exists. We will limit our attention to a continuous strictly monotone
function and use the Continuous Inverse Theorem 5.6.5 to ensure the existence of a
continuous inverse function.
If f is a continuous strictly monotone function on an interval I, then its inverse function
g ¼ f #1 is defined on the interval J :¼ f ðI Þ and satisfies the relation
g f ðxÞ ¼ x

for

x 2 I:

If c 2 I and d :¼ f ðcÞ, and if we knew that both f 0 ðcÞ and g0 ðd Þ exist, then we could
differentiate both sides of the equation and apply the Chain Rule to the left side to get
g0 f ðcÞ # f 0 ðcÞ ¼ 1. Thus, if f 0 ðcÞ 6¼ 0, we would obtain

However, it is necessary to deduce the differentiability of the inverse function g from the
assumed differentiability of f before such a calculation can be performed. This is nicely
accomplished by using Carath#eodory’s Theorem.
6.1.8 Theorem Let I be an interval in R and let f : I ! R be strictly monotone and
continuous on I. Let J :¼ f ðI Þ and let g : J ! R be the strictly monotone and continuous
function inverse to f. If f is differentiable at c 2 I and f 0 ðcÞ 6¼ 0, then g is differentiable at
d :¼ f ðcÞ and
g0 ð d Þ ¼

f 0 ðcÞ f 0 ðgðd ÞÞ

Proof. Given c 2 R, we obtain from Carath#eodory’s Theorem 6.1.5 a function w on I with
properties that w is continuous at c; f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ ¼ wðxÞðx # cÞ for x 2 I, and wðcÞ ¼ f 0 ðcÞ.
Since wðcÞ 6¼ 0 by hypothesis, there exists a neighborhood V :¼ ðc # d; c þ dÞ such that
wðxÞ 6¼ 0 for all x 2 V \ I. (See Theorem 4.2.9.) If U :¼ f ðV \ I Þ, then the inverse
function g satisfies f ðgðyÞÞ ¼ y for all y 2 U, so that
y # d ¼ f ðgðyÞÞ # f ðcÞ ¼ wðgðyÞÞ # ðgðyÞ # gðd ÞÞ:
Since wðgðyÞÞ 6¼ 0 for y 2 U, we can divide to get
gðyÞ # gðd Þ ¼

1
# ðy # d Þ:
w ð gð y Þ Þ

Since the function 1=ðw # gÞ is continuous at d, we apply Theorem 6.1.5 to conclude that
g0 ðd Þ exists and g0 ðd Þ ¼ 1=wðgðd ÞÞ ¼ 1=wðcÞ ¼ 1=f 0 ðcÞ:
Q.E.D.
Note The hypothesis, made in Theorem 6.1.8, that f 0 ðcÞ 6¼ 0 is essential. In fact, if
f 0 ðcÞ ¼ 0, then the inverse function g is never differentiable at d ¼ f ðcÞ, since the assumed
existence of g0 ðd Þ would lead to 1 ¼ f 0 ðcÞg0 ðd Þ ¼ 0, which is impossible. The function
f ðxÞ :¼ x3 with c ¼ 0 is such an example.
6.1.9 Theorem Let I be an interval and let f : I ! R be strictly monotone on I. Let
J :¼ f ðI Þ and let g : J ! R be the function inverse to f. If f is differentiable on I and
f 0 ðxÞ 6¼ 0 for x 2 I, then g is differentiable on J and
g0 ¼

Proof. If f is differentiable on I, then Theorem 6.1.2 implies that f is continuous on I, and
by the Continuous Inverse Theorem 5.6.5, the inverse function g is continuous on J.
Equation (13) now follows from Theorem 6.1.8.
Q.E.D.
Remark If f and g are the functions of Theorem 6.1.9, and if x 2 I and y 2 J are related
by y ¼ f ðxÞ and x ¼ gðyÞ, then equation (13) can be written in the form
g0 ð y Þ ¼

It can also be written in the form g0 ðyÞ ¼ 1=f 0 ðxÞ, provided that it is kept in mind that x and
y are related by y ¼ f ðxÞ and x ¼ gðyÞ.

CHAPTER 6 DIFFERENTIATION

6.1.10 Examples (a) The function f : R ! R defined by f ðxÞ :¼ x5 þ 4x þ 3 is continuous and strictly monotone increasing (since it is the sum of two strictly increasing
functions). Moreover, f 0 ðxÞ ¼ 5x4 þ 4 is never zero. Therefore, by Theorem 6.1.8, the
inverse function g ¼ f #1 is differentiable at every point. If we take c ¼ 1, then since
f ð1Þ ¼ 8, we obtain g0 ð8Þ ¼ g0 ð f ð1ÞÞ ¼ 1=f 0 ð1Þ ¼ 1=9.
(b) Let n 2 N be even, let I :¼ ½0; 1Þ, and let f ðxÞ :¼ xn for x 2 I. It was seen at the end
of Section 5.6 that f is strictly increasing and continuous on I, so that its inverse function
gðyÞ :¼ y1=n for y 2 J :¼ ½0; 1Þ is also strictly increasing and continuous on J. Moreover,
we have f 0 ðxÞ ¼ nx n#1 for all x 2 I. Hence it follows that if y &gt; 0, then g0 ðyÞ exists and

(c) Let n 2 N, n 6¼ 1, be odd, let F ðxÞ :¼ xn for x 2 R, and let GðyÞ :¼ y1=n be its inverse
function defined for all y 2 R. As in part (b) we find that G is differentiable for y 6¼ 0 and
that G0 ðyÞ ¼ ð1=nÞyð1=nÞ#1 for y 6¼ 0. However, G is not differentiable at 0, even though G is
differentiable for all y 6¼ 0. (For a graph of F and G, see Figures 5.6.6 and 5.6.7.)
(d) Let r :¼ m=n be a positive rational number, let I :¼ ½0; 1Þ, and let RðxÞ :¼ xr for
x 2 I. (Recall Definition 5.6.6.) Then R is the composition of the functions f ðxÞ :¼ xm and
gðxÞ :¼ x1=n ; x 2 I. That is, RðxÞ ¼ f ðgðxÞÞ for x 2 I. If we apply the Chain Rule 6.1.6
and the results of (b) [or (c), depending on whether n is even or odd], then we obtain

and R0 ð0Þ ¼ 0. (For a graph of R see Figure 5.6.8.)
(e) The sine function is strictly increasing on the interval I :¼ ½#p=2; p=2#; therefore its
inverse function, which we will denote by Arcsin, exists on J :¼ ½#1; 1#. That is, if x 2
½#p=2; p=2# and y 2 ½#1; 1# then y ¼ sin x if and only if Arcsin y ¼ x. It was asserted
(without proof) in Example 6.1.7(d) that sin is differentiable on I and that D sin x ¼ cos x
for x 2 I. Since cos x 6¼ 0 for x in ð#p=2; p=2Þ it follows from Theorem 6.1.8 that

CHAPTER 6 DIFFERENTIATION

Section 6.2 The Mean Value Theorem
The Mean Value Theorem, which relates the values of a function to values of its derivative,
is one of the most useful results in real analysis. In this section we will establish this
important theorem and sample some of its many consequences.
We begin by looking at the relationship between the relative extrema of a function and
the values of its derivative. Recall that the function f : I ! R is said to have a relative
maximum [respectively, relative minimum] at c 2 I if there exists a neighborhood
V :¼ V d ðcÞ of c such that f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ [respectively, f ðcÞ # f ðxÞ] for all x in V \ I. We
say that f has a relative extremum at c 2 I if it has either a relative maximum or a relative
minimum at c.
The next result provides the theoretical justification for the familiar process of finding
points at which f has relative extrema by examining the zeros of the derivative. However, it
must be realized that this procedure applies only to interior points of the interval. For
example, if f ðxÞ :¼ x on the interval I :¼ ½0; 1#, then the endpoint x ¼ 0 yields the unique
relative minimum and the endpoint x ¼ 1 yields the unique maximum of f on I, but neither
point is a zero of the derivative of f.
6.2.1 Interior Extremum Theorem Let c be an interior point of the interval I at which
f : I ! R has a relative extremum. If the derivative of f at c exists, then f 0 ðcÞ ¼ 0.
Proof. We will prove the result only for the case that f has a relative maximum at c; the
proof for the case of a relative minimum is similar.
If f 0 ðcÞ &gt; 0, then by Theorem 4.2.9 there exists a neighborhood V # I of c such that
f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ
&gt; 0 for
x#c
If x 2 V and x &gt; c, then we have

x 2 V; x 6¼ c:

f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ
&gt; 0:
x#c
But this contradicts the hypothesis that f has a relative maximum at c. Thus we cannot
have f 0 ðcÞ &gt; 0. Similarly (how?), we cannot have f 0 ðcÞ &lt; 0. Therefore we must have
f 0 ðcÞ ¼ 0.
Q.E.D.
f ð xÞ # f ð c Þ ¼ ð x # c Þ #

6.2.2 Corollary Let f : I ! R be continuous on an interval I and suppose that f has a
relative extremum at an interior point c of I. Then either the derivative of f at c does not
exist, or it is equal to zero.
We note that if f ðxÞ :¼ jxj on I :¼ ½#1; 1#, then f has an interior minimum at x ¼ 0;
however, the derivative of f fails to exist at x ¼ 0.
6.2.3 Rolle’s Theorem Suppose that f is continuous on a closed interval I :¼ ½a; b#, that
the derivative f 0 exists at every point of the open interval (a, b), and that f ðaÞ ¼ f ðbÞ ¼ 0.
Then there exists at least one point c in (a, b) such that f 0 ðcÞ ¼ 0.
Proof. If f vanishes identically on I, then any c in (a, b) will satisfy the conclusion of the
theorem. Hence we suppose that f does not vanish identically; replacing f by #f if
necessary, we may suppose that f assumes some positive values. By the MaximumMinimum Theorem 5.3.4, the function f attains the value supf f ðxÞ : x 2 I g &gt; 0 at some
point c in I. Since f ðaÞ ¼ f ðbÞ ¼ 0, the point c must lie in (a, b); therefore f 0 ðcÞ exists.

Q.E.D.

Remark The geometric view of the Mean Value Theorem is that there is some point on
the curve y ¼ f ðxÞ at which the tangent line is parallel to the line segment through the
points (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)). Thus it is easy to remember the statement of the Mean Value
Theorem by drawing appropriate diagrams. While this should not be discouraged, it tends
to suggest that its importance is geometrical in nature, which is quite misleading. In fact the
Mean Value Theorem is a wolf in sheep’s clothing and is the Fundamental Theorem of
Differential Calculus. In the remainder of this section, we will present some of the
consequences of this result. Other applications will be given later.
The Mean Value Theorem permits one to draw conclusions about the nature of a
function f from information about its derivative f 0 . The following results are obtained in
this manner.
6.2.5 Theorem Suppose that f is continuous on the closed interval I :¼ ½a; b#, that f is
differentiable on the open interval (a, b), and that f 0 ðxÞ ¼ 0 for x 2 ða; bÞ. Then f is
constant on I.
Proof. We will show that f ðxÞ ¼ f ðaÞ for all x 2 I. Indeed, if x 2 I, x &gt; a, is given,
we apply the Mean Value Theorem to f on the closed interval ½a, x#. We obtain a
point c (depending on x) between a and x such that f ðxÞ # f ðaÞ ¼ f 0 ðcÞðx # aÞ. Since
f 0 ðcÞ ¼ 0 (by hypothesis), we deduce that f ðxÞ # f ðaÞ ¼ 0. Hence, f ðxÞ ¼ f ðaÞ for
any x 2 I.
Q.E.D.
6.2.6 Corollary Suppose that f and g are continuous on I :¼ ½a; b#, that they are
differentiable on (a, b), and that f 0 ðxÞ ¼ g0 ðxÞ for all x 2 ða; bÞ. Then there exists a
constant C such that f ¼ g þ C on I.
Recall that a function f : I ! R is said to be increasing on the interval I if whenever
x1 ; x2 in I satisfy x1 &lt; x2, then f ðx1 Þ # f ðx2 Þ. Also recall that f is decreasing on I if the
function # f is increasing on I.
6.2.7 Theorem Let f : I ! R be differentiable on the interval I. Then:
(a) f is increasing on I if and only if f 0 ðxÞ # 0 for all x 2 I.
(b) f is decreasing on I if and only if f 0 ðxÞ # 0 for all x 2 I.
Proof. (a) Suppose that f 0 ðxÞ # 0 for all x 2 I. If x1 ; x2 in I satisfy x1 &lt; x2, then we
apply the Mean Value Theorem to f on the closed interval J :¼ ½x1 ; x2 # to obtain a point c in
ðx1 ; x2 Þ such that
f ðx2 Þ # f ðx1 Þ ¼ f 0 ðcÞðx2 # x1 Þ:

6.2 THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM

Since f 0 ðcÞ # 0 and x2 # x1 &gt; 0, it follows that f ðx2 Þ # f ðx1 Þ # 0. (Why?) Hence,
f ðx1 Þ # f ðx2 Þ and, since x1 &lt; x2 are arbitrary points in I, we conclude that f is
increasing on I.
For the converse assertion, we suppose that f is differentiable and increasing on I.
Thus, for any point x 6¼ c in I, we have ð f ðxÞ # f ðcÞÞ=ðx # cÞ # 0. (Why?) Hence, by
Theorem 4.2.6 we conclude that
f 0 ðcÞ ¼ lim

(b) The proof of part (b) is similar and will be omitted.

Q.E.D.

A function f is said to be strictly increasing on an interval I if for any points x1 ; x2 in I
such that x1 &lt; x2 , we have f ðx1 Þ &lt; f ðx2 Þ. An argument along the same lines of the proof
of Theorem 6.2.7 can be made to show that a function having a strictly positive derivative
on an interval is strictly increasing there. (See Exercise 13.) However, the converse
assertion is not true, since a strictly increasing differentiable function may have a derivative
that vanishes at certain points. For example, the function f : R ! R defined by f ðxÞ :¼ x3
is strictly increasing on R, but f 0 ð0Þ ¼ 0. The situation for strictly decreasing functions is
similar.
Remark It is reasonable to define a function to be increasing at a point if there is a
neighborhood of the point on which the function is increasing. One might suppose that, if
the derivative is strictly positive at a point, then the function is increasing at this point.
However, this supposition is false; indeed, the differentiable function defined by
gðxÞ :¼

x þ 2x2 sin ð1=xÞ
0

if
if

x 6¼ 0;
x ¼ 0;

is such that g0 ð0Þ ¼ 1, yet it can be shown that g is not increasing in any neighborhood of
x ¼ 0. (See Exercise 10.)
We next obtain a sufficient condition for a function to have a relative extremum at an
interior point of an interval.
6.2.8 First Derivative Test for Extrema Let f be continuous on the interval I :¼ ½a; b#
and let c be an interior point of I. Assume that f is differentiable on (a, c) and (c, b) . Then:
(a)
and
(b)
and

If there is a neighborhood ðc # d; c þ dÞ # I such that f 0 ðxÞ # 0 for c # d &lt; x &lt; c
f 0 ðxÞ # 0 for c &lt; x &lt; c þ d, then f has a relative maximum at c.
If there is a neighborhood ðc # d; c þ dÞ # I such that f 0 ðxÞ # 0 for c # d &lt; x &lt; c
f 0 ðxÞ # 0 for c &lt; x &lt; c þ d, then f has a relative minimum at c.

Proof. (a) If x 2 ðc # d; cÞ, then it follows from the Mean Value Theorem that there
exists a point cx 2 ðx; cÞ such that f ðcÞ # f ðxÞ ¼ ðc # xÞ f 0 ðcx Þ. Since f 0 ðcx Þ # 0 we infer
that f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ for x 2 ðc # d; cÞ. Similarly, it follows (how?) that f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ
for x 2 ðc; c þ dÞ. Therefore f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ for all x 2 ðc # d; c þ dÞ so that f has a relative
maximum at c.
(b) The proof is similar.
Q.E.D.
Remark The converse of the First Derivative Test 6.2.8 is not true. For example, there
exists a differentiable function f : R ! R with absolute minimum at x ¼ 0 but such that

f 0 takes on both positive and negative values on both sides of (and arbitrarily close to)
x ¼ 0. (See Exercise 9.)
Further Applications of the Mean Value Theorem
We will continue giving other types of applications of the Mean Value Theorem; in doing
so we will draw more freely than before on the past experience of the reader and his or her
knowledge concerning the derivatives of certain well-known functions.
6.2.9 Examples (a) Rolle’s Theorem can be used for the location of roots of a function.
For, if a function g can be identified as the derivative of a function f, then between any two
roots of f there is at least one root of g. For example, let gðxÞ :¼ cos x, then g is known to be
the derivative of f ðxÞ :¼ sin x. Hence, between any two roots of sin x there is at least one
root of cos x. On the other hand, g0 ðxÞ ¼ #sin x ¼ #f ðxÞ, so another application of Rolle’s
Theorem tells us that between any two roots of cos there is at least one root of sin.
Therefore, we conclude that the roots of sin and cos interlace each other. This conclusion is
probably not news to the reader; however, the same type of argument can be applied to the
Bessel functions Jn of order n ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . by using the relations
0

½xn J n ðxÞ#0 ¼ xn J n#1 ðxÞ; ½xn#1 J n ðxÞ# ¼ #x#n J nþ1 ðxÞ

for

x &gt; 0:

The details of this argument should be supplied by the reader.
(b) We can apply the Mean Value Theorem for approximatepcalculations
and to obtain

Inequalities
One very important use of the Mean Value Theorem is to obtain certain inequalities.
Whenever information concerning the range of the derivative of a function is available, this
information can be used to deduce certain properties of the function itself. The following
examples illustrate the valuable role that the Mean Value Theorem plays in this respect.

6.2 THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM

177

6.2.10 Examples (a) The exponential function f ðxÞ :¼ ex has the derivative f 0 ðxÞ ¼ ex
for all x 2 R. Thus f 0 ðxÞ &gt; 1 for x &gt; 0, and f 0 ðxÞ &lt; 1 for x &lt; 0. From these relationships,
we will derive the inequality
ð1Þ

ex # 1 þ x for

x 2 R;

with equality occurring if and only if x ¼ 0.
If x ¼ 0, we have equality with both sides equal to 1. If x &gt; 0, we apply the Mean
Value Theorem to the function f on the interval [0, x]. Then for some c with 0 &lt; c &lt; x
we have
ex # e0 ¼ ec ðx # 0Þ:
Since e0 ¼ 1 and ec &gt; 1, this becomes ex # 1 &gt; x so that we have ex &gt; 1 þ x for x &gt; 0. A
similar argument establishes the same strict inequality for x &lt; 0. Thus the inequality (1)
holds for all x, and equality occurs only if x ¼ 0.
(b) The function gðxÞ :¼ sin x has the derivative g0 ðxÞ ¼ cos x for all x 2 R. On the basis
of the fact that #1 # cos x # 1 for all x 2 R, we will show that
ð2Þ

#x # sin x # x

for all x # 0:

Indeed, if we apply the Mean Value Theorem to g on the interval [0, x], where x &gt; 0, we
obtain
sin x # sin 0 ¼ ðcos cÞðx # 0Þ
for some c between 0 and x. Since sin 0 ¼ 0 and #1 # cos c # 1, we have #x # sin x # x.
Since equality holds at x ¼ 0, the inequality (2) is established.
(c) (Bernoulli’s inequality) If a &gt; 1, then
ð3Þ

ð1 þ xÞa # 1 þ ax

for all

x &gt; #1;

with equality if and only if x ¼ 0.
This inequality was established earlier, in Example 2.1.13(c), for positive integer
values of a by using Mathematical Induction. We now derive the more general version by
employing the Mean Value Theorem.
If hðxÞ :¼ ð1 þ xÞa then h0 ðxÞ ¼ að1 þ xÞa#1 for all x &gt; #1. [For rational a this
derivative was established in Example 6.1.10(c). The extension to irrational will be
discussed in Section 8.3.] If x &gt; 0, we infer from the Mean Value Theorem applied to
h on the interval [0, x] that there exists c with 0 &lt; c &lt; x such that hðxÞ # hð0Þ ¼ h0 ðcÞðx # 0Þ.
Thus, we have
ð1 þ xÞa # 1 ¼ að1 þ cÞa#1 x:
Since c &gt; 0 and a # 1 &gt; 0, it follows that ð1 þ cÞa#1 &gt; 1 and hence that ð1 þ xÞa &gt;
1 þ ax. If #1 &lt; x &lt; 0, a similar use of the Mean Value Theorem on the interval [x, 0] leads
to the same strict inequality. Since the case x ¼ 0 results in equality, we conclude that (3) is
valid for all x &gt; #1 with equality if and only if x ¼ 0.
(d) Let a be a real number satisfying 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 and let gðxÞ ¼ ax # xa for x # 0. Then
g0 ðxÞ ¼ að1 # xa#1 Þ, so that g0 ðxÞ &lt; 0 for 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 and g0 ðxÞ &gt; 0 for x &gt; 1. Consequently, if x # 0, then gðxÞ # gð1Þ and gðxÞ ¼ gð1Þ if and only if x ¼ 1. Therefore, if
x # 0 and 0 &lt; a &lt; 1, then we have
xa # a x þ ð1 # aÞ:

The Intermediate Value Property of Derivatives

We conclude this section with an interesting result, often referred to as Darboux’s Theorem. It
states that if a function f is differentiable at every point of an interval I, then the function f 0 has
the Intermediate Value Property. This means that if f 0 takes on values A and B, then it also
takes on all values between A and B. The reader will recognize this property as one of the
important consequences of continuity as established in Theorem 5.3.7. It is remarkable that
derivatives, which need not be continuous functions, also possess this property.
6.2.11 Lemma Let I # R be an interval, let f : I ! R, let c 2 I, and assume that f has a
derivative at c. Then:
(a) If f 0 ðcÞ &gt; 0, then there is a number d &gt; 0 such that f ðxÞ &gt; f ðcÞ for x 2 I such that
c &lt; x &lt; c þ d.
(b) If f 0 ðcÞ &lt; 0, then there is a number d &gt; 0 such that f ðxÞ &gt; f ðcÞ for x 2 I such that
c # d &lt; x &lt; c.
Proof. (a) Since
f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ
¼ f 0 ðcÞ &gt; 0;

it follows from Theorem 4.2.9 that there is a number d &gt; 0 such that if x 2 I and

&gt; 0:

If x 2 I also satisfies x &gt; c, then we have
f ðxÞ # f ðcÞ

Hence, if x 2 I and c &lt; x &lt; c þ d, then f ðxÞ &gt; f ðcÞ.
The proof of (b) is similar.

6.2.12 Darboux’s Theorem If f is differentiable on I ¼ ½a; b# and if k is a number
between f 0 ðaÞ and f 0 ðbÞ, then there is at least one point c in (a, b) such that f 0 ðcÞ ¼ k.
Proof. Suppose that f 0 ðaÞ &lt; k &lt; f 0 ðbÞ. We define g on I by gðxÞ :¼ kx # f ðxÞ for x 2 I.
Since g is continuous, it attains a maximum value on I. Since g0 ðaÞ ¼ k # f 0 ðaÞ &gt; 0, it
follows from Lemma 6.2.11(a) that the maximum of g does not occur at x ¼ a. Similarly,
since g0 ðbÞ ¼ k # f 0 ðbÞ &lt; 0, it follows from Lemma 6.2.11(b) that the maximum does not
occur at x ¼ b. Therefore, g attains its maximum at some c in (a, b). Then from Theorem
6.2.1 we have 0 ¼ g0 ðcÞ ¼ k # f 0 ðcÞ. Hence, f 0 ðcÞ ¼ k.

Section 6.3 L’Hospital’s Rules
In this section we will discuss limit theorems that involve cases that cannot be determined
by previous limit theorems. For example, if f (x) and g(x) both approach 0 as x approaches
a, then the quotient f ðxÞ=gðxÞ may or may not have a limit at a and it is said to have the
indeterminate form 0/0. The limit theorem for this case is due to Johann Bernoulli and first
appeared in the 1696 book published by L’Hospital.

Johann Bernoulli
Johann Bernoulli (1667–1748) was born in Basel, Switzerland. Johann
worked for a year in his father’s spice business, but he was not a success.
He enrolled in Basel University to study medicine, but his brother Jacob,
twelve years older and a Professor of Mathematics, led him into mathematics.
Together, they studied the papers of Leibniz on the new subject of calculus.
Johann received his doctorate at Basel University and joined the faculty at
Groningen in Holland, but upon Jacob’s death in 1705, he returned to Basel
and was awarded Jacob’s chair in mathematics. Because of his many advances
in the subject, Johann is regarded as one of the founders of calculus.
While in Paris in 1692, Johann met the Marquis Guillame Francois de L’Hospital and agreed
to a financial arrangement under which he would teach the new calculus to L’Hospital, giving
L’Hospital the right to use Bernoulli’s lessons as he pleased. This was subsequently continued
through a series of letters. In 1696, the first book on differential calculus, L’Analyse des Infiniment
Petits, was published by L’Hospital. Though L’Hospital’s name was not on the title page, his
portrait was on the frontispiece and the preface states ‘‘I am indebted to the clarifications of the
brothers Bernoulli, especially the younger.’’ The book contains a theorem on limits later known as
L’Hospital’s Rule although it was in fact discovered by Johann Bernoulli. In 1922, manuscripts
were discovered that confirmed the book consisted mainly of Bernoulli’s lessons. And in 1955,
the L’Hospital–Bernoulli correspondence was published in Germany.

The initial theorem was refined and extended, and the various results are collectively
referred to as L’Hospital’s (or L’H^
opital’s) Rules. In this section we establish the most basic
of these results and indicate how others can be derived.
Indeterminate Forms
In the preceding chapters we have often been concerned with methods of evaluating limits. It
was shown in Theorem 4.2.4(b) that if A :¼ lim f ðxÞ and B :¼ lim gðxÞ, and if B 6¼ 0, then
x!c

x!c

f ðxÞ
A
¼ :
x!c gðxÞ
B
lim

However, if B ¼ 0, then no conclusion was deduced. It will be seen in Exercise 2 that if
B ¼ 0 and A 6¼ 0, then the limit is infinite (when it exists).
The case A ¼ 0, B ¼ 0 has not been covered previously. In this case, the limit of the
quotient f=g is said to be ‘‘indeterminate.’’ We will see that in this case the limit may not
exist or may be any real value, depending on the particular functions f and g. The
symbolism 0=0 is used to refer to this situation. For example, if a is any real number, and if
we define f ðxÞ :¼ ax and gðxÞ :¼ x, then
f ð xÞ
ax
lim
¼ lim
¼ lim a ¼ a:
x!0 gðxÞ
x!0 x
x!0
Thus the indeterminate form 0=0 can lead to any real number a as a limit.
Other indeterminate forms are represented by the symbols 1=1; 0 # 1;
00 ; 11 ; 10 ; and 1 # 1. These notations correspond to the indicated limiting behavior
and juxtaposition of the functions f and g. Our attention will be focused on the indeterminate
forms 0=0 and 1=1. The other indeterminate cases are usually reduced to the form 0=0 or
1=1 by taking logarithms, exponentials, or algebraic manipulations.
A Preliminary Result
To show that the use of differentiation in this context is a natural and not surprising
development, we first establish an elementary result that is based simply on the definition
of the derivative.
6.3.1 Theorem Let f and g be defined on [a, b], let f ðaÞ ¼ gðaÞ ¼ 0, and let gðxÞ 6¼ 0 for
a &lt; x &lt; b. If f and g are differentiable at a and if g0 ðaÞ 6¼ 0, then the limit of f=g at a
exists and is equal to f 0 ðaÞ=g0 ðaÞ. Thus
f ðxÞ f 0 ðaÞ
¼ 0 :
lim
x!aþ gðxÞ
g ðaÞ
Proof. Since f ðaÞ ¼ gðaÞ ¼ 0, we can write the quotient f ðxÞ=gðxÞ for a &lt; x &lt; b
as follows:
f ðxÞ # f ðaÞ
f ðxÞ f ðxÞ # f ðaÞ

lim

To handle limits where f and g are not differentiable at the point a, we need a more general
version of the Mean Value Theorem due to Cauchy.
6.3.2 Cauchy Mean Value Theorem Let f and g be continuous on [a, b] and
differentiable on (a, b), and assume that g0 ðxÞ 6¼ 0 for all x in (a, b). Then there exists
c in (a, b) such that
f ðbÞ # f ðaÞ f 0 ðcÞ
¼
:
gðbÞ # gðaÞ g0 ðcÞ
Proof. As in the proof of the Mean Value Theorem, we introduce a function to which
Rolle’s Theorem will apply. First we note that since g0 ðxÞ 6¼ 0 for all x in (a, b), it follows
from Rolle’s Theorem that gðaÞ 6¼ gðbÞ. For x in [a, b], we now define
hðxÞ :¼

f ð bÞ # f ð aÞ
ðgðxÞ # gðaÞÞ # ð f ðxÞ # f ðaÞÞ:
gð bÞ # gð aÞ

Then h is continuous on [a, b], differentiable on (a, b), and hðaÞ ¼ hðbÞ ¼ 0. Therefore, it
follows from Rolle’s Theorem 6.2.3 that there exists a point c in (a, b) such that
0 ¼ h0 ð c Þ ¼

f ð bÞ # f ð aÞ 0
g ðcÞ # f 0 ðcÞ:
gð bÞ # gð aÞ

Since g0 ðcÞ 6¼ 0, we obtain the desired result by dividing by g0 ðcÞ.

Q.E.D.

Remarks The preceding theorem has a geometric interpretation that is similar to that of
the Mean Value Theorem 6.2.4. The functions f and g can be viewed as determining a curve
in the plane by means of the parametric equations x ¼ f ðtÞ; y ¼ gðtÞ where a # t # b.
Then the conclusion of the theorem is that there exists a point ð f ðcÞ; gðcÞÞ on the curve for
some c in (a, b) such that the slope g0 ðcÞ=f 0 ðcÞ of the line tangent to the curve at that point is
equal to the slope of the line segment joining the endpoints of the curve.
Note that if gðxÞ ¼ x, then the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem reduces to the Mean
Value Theorem 6.2.4.

L’Hospital’s Rule, I
We will now establish the first of L’Hospital’s Rules. For convenience, we will consider
right-hand limits at a point a; left-hand limits, and two-sided limits are treated in exactly
the same way. In fact, the theorem even allows the possibility that a ¼ #1. The reader
should observe that, in contrast with Theorem 6.3.1, the following result does not assume
the differentiability of the functions at the point a. The result asserts that the limiting
behavior of f ðxÞ=gðxÞ as x ! aþ is the same as the limiting behavior of f 0 ðxÞ=g0 ðxÞ as

both f and g approach 0 as x ! aþ.

Observe that the denominator is not differentiable
pﬃﬃﬃat x ¼ 0 so that Theorem 6.3.1
cannot be applied. However f ðxÞ :¼ sin x and gðxÞ :¼ x are differentiable on (0, 1) and
both approach 0 as x ! 0þ. Moreover, g0 ðxÞ 6¼ 0 on (0, 1), so that 6.3.3 is applicable.

L’Hospital’s Rule, II
This rule is very similar to the first one, except that it treats the case where the denominator
becomes infinite as x ! aþ. Again we will consider only right-hand limits, but it is
possible that a ¼ #1. Left-hand limits and two-sided limits are handled similarly.
6.3.5 L’Hospital’s Rule, II Let #1 # a &lt; b # 1 and let f, g be differentiable on (a, b)

proof of 6.3.3 holds for some u 2 ða; bÞ.
Case (a): If L 2 R with L &gt; 0 and e &gt; 0 is given, there is c 2 ða; bÞ such that (3) in the
proof of 6.3.3 holds when a &lt; a &lt; b # c. Since gðxÞ ! 1, we may also assume that

Since gðcÞ=gðaÞ ! 0 as a ! aþ, we may assume that 0 &lt; gðcÞ=gðaÞ &lt; 1 for all

Section 6.4 Taylor’s Theorem
A very useful technique in the analysis of real functions is the approximation of functions
by polynomials. In this section we will prove a fundamental theorem in this area that goes
back to Brook Taylor (1685–1731), although the remainder term was not provided until
much later by Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813). Taylor’s Theorem is a powerful result
that has many applications. We will illustrate the versatility of Taylor’s Theorem by briefly
discussing some of its applications to numerical estimation, inequalities, extreme values of
a function, and convex functions.
Taylor’s Theorem can be regarded as an extension of the Mean Value Theorem to
‘‘higher order’’ derivatives. Whereas the Mean Value Theorem relates the values of a
function and its first derivative, Taylor’s Theorem provides a relation between the values of
a function and its higher order derivatives.
Derivatives of order greater than one are obtained by a natural extension of the
differentiation process. If the derivative f 0 ðxÞ of a function f exists at every point x in an
interval I containing a point c, then we can consider the existence of the derivative of the
function f 0 at the point c. In case f 0 has a derivative at the point c, we refer to the resulting
number as the second derivative of f at c, and we denote this number by f 00 ðcÞ or by
f (2)(c). In similar fashion we define the third derivative f 000 ðcÞ ¼ f ð3Þ ðcÞ; . . ., and the nth
derivative f (n)(c), whenever these derivatives exist. It is noted that the existence of the
nth derivative at c presumes the existence of the (n # l)st derivative in an interval
containing c, but we do allow the possibility that c might be an endpoint of such an
interval.
If a function f has an nth derivative at a point x0, it is not difficult to construct an
ðkÞ
nth degree polynomial Pn such that Pn ðx0 Þ ¼ f ðx0 Þ and PðkÞ
ðx0 Þ for
n ðx0 Þ ¼ f

has the property that it and its derivatives up to order n agree with the function f and its
derivatives up to order n, at the specified point x0. This polynomial Pn is called the nth
Taylor polynomial for f at x0. It is natural to expect this polynomial to provide a
reasonable approximation to f for points near x0, but to gauge the quality of the
approximation, it is necessary to have information concerning the remainder
Rn :¼ f # Pn . The following fundamental result provides such information.
6.4.1 Taylor’s Theorem Let n 2 N, let I :¼ ½a; b#, and let f : I ! R be such that f and
its derivatives f 0 ; f 00 ; . . .; f ðnÞ are continuous on I and that f ðnþ1Þ exists on (a, b). If x0 2 I,
then for any x in I there exists a point c between x and x0 such that

Proof. Let x0 and x be given and let J denote the closed interval with endpoints x0 and x.
We define the function F on J by

Q.E.D.

We shall use the notation Pn for the nth Taylor polynomial (1) of f, and Rn for the
remainder. Thus we may write the conclusion of Taylor’s Theorem as f ðxÞ ¼ Pn ðxÞ þ

for some point c between x and x0. This formula for Rn is referred to as the Lagrange form
(or the derivative form) of the remainder. Many other expressions for Rn are known; one is
in terms of integration and will be given later. (See Theorem 7.3.18.)

Applications of Taylor’s Theorem
The remainder term Rn in Taylor’s Theorem can be used to estimate the error in
approximating a function by its Taylor polynomial Pn. If the number n is prescribed,
then the question of the accuracy of the approximation arises. On the other hand, if a certain
accuracy is specified, then the question of finding a suitable value of n is germane. The
following examples illustrate how one responds to these questions.
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
6.4.2 Examples (a) Use Taylor’s Theorem with n ¼ 2 to approximate 3 1 þ x; x &gt; #1.
1=3
We take the function f ðxÞ :¼ ð1 þ xÞ , the point x0 ¼ 0, and n ¼ 2. Since f 0 ðxÞ ¼
#2=3
1
and f 00 ðxÞ ¼ 13 ð# 23Þð1 þ xÞ#5=3 , we have f 0 ð0Þ ¼ 13 and f 00 ð0Þ ¼ #2=9. Thus
3 ð1 þ xÞ
we obtain
f ðxÞ ¼ P2 ðxÞ þ R2 ðxÞ ¼ 1 þ 13 x # 19 x2 þ R2 ðxÞ;
5
ð1 þ cÞ#8=3 x3 for some point c between 0 and x.
where R2 ðxÞ ¼ 3!1 f 000 ðcÞx3 ¼ 81
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
For example, if we let x ¼ 0.3, we get the approximation P2(0.3) ¼ 1.09 for 3 1:3:
Moreover, since c &gt; 0 in this case, then ð1 þ cÞ#8=3 &lt; 1 and so the error is at most

5 3 3
1
&lt; 0:17 10#2 :
R2 ð0:3Þ #
¼
81 10
600
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Hence, we have j 3 1:3#1:09j &lt; 0:5 10#2 , so that two decimal place accuracy is assured.
(b) Approximate the number e with error less than 10#5 .
We shall consider the function gðxÞ :¼ ex and take x0 ¼ 0 and x ¼ 1 in Taylor’s
Theorem. We need to determine n so that jRn ð1Þj &lt; 10#5 . To do so, we shall use the fact
that g0 ðxÞ ¼ ex and the initial bound of ex # 3 for 0 # x # 1.
Since g0 ðxÞ ¼ ex , it follows that gðkÞ ðxÞ ¼ ex for all k 2 N, and therefore gðkÞ ð0Þ ¼ 1
for all k 2 N. Consequently the nth Taylor polynomial is given by

x2

þ ### þ
2!
n!
c
and the remainder for x ¼ 1 is given by Rn ð1Þ ¼ e =ðn þ 1Þ! for some c satisfying 0 &lt; c &lt; 1.
Since ec &lt; 3, we seek a value of n such that 3=ðn þ 1Þ! &lt; 10#5 . A calculation reveals that
9! ¼ 362; 880 &gt; 3 105 so that the value n ¼ 8 will provide the desired accuracy; moreover,
since 8! ¼ 40; 320, no smaller value of n will be certain to suffice. Thus, we obtain

If 0 # x # p, then 0 # c &lt; p; since c and x3 are both positive, we have R2 ðxÞ # 0. Also,
if #p # x # 0, then #p # c # 0; since sin c and x3 are both negative, we again have
R2 ðxÞ # 0. Therefore, we see that 1 # 12 x2 # cos x for jxj # p. If jxj # p, then we have
1 # 12 x2 &lt; #3 # cos x and the inequality is trivially valid. Hence, the inequality holds for

n
and the remainder is given by

for some c satisfying 0 &lt; c &lt; x. Thus for any x &gt; 0, if n ¼ 2k is even, then we have
R2k ðxÞ &gt; 0; and if n ¼ 2k þ 1 is odd, then we have R2kþ1 ðxÞ &lt; 0. The stated inequality
then follows immediately.
(c) ep &gt; pe
Taylor’s Theorem gives us the inequality ex &gt; 1 þ x for x &gt; 0, which the reader

Rn ðxÞ ¼

This implies e

p=e

eðp=e#1Þ &gt; 1 þ ðp=e # 1Þ ¼ p=e:
&gt; ðp=eÞe ¼ p, and thus we obtain the inequality ep &gt; pe.

Relative Extrema
It was established in Theorem 6.2.1 that if a function f : I ! R is differentiable at a point c
interior to the interval I, then a necessary condition for f to have a relative extremum at c is
that f 0 ðcÞ ¼ 0. One way to determine whether f has a relative maximum or relative
minimum [or neither] at c is to use the First Derivative Test 6.2.8. Higher order derivatives,
if they exist, can also be used in this determination, as we now show.
6.4.4 Theorem Let I be an interval, let x0 be an interior point of I, and let n # 2.
Suppose that the derivatives f 0 ; f 00 . . . ; f ðnÞ exist and are continuous in a neighborhood
of x0 and that f 0 ðx0 Þ ¼ # # # ¼ f ðn#1Þ ðx0 Þ ¼ 0, but f ðnÞ ðx0 Þ 6¼ 0.
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

If n is even and f ðnÞ ðx0 Þ &gt; 0, then f has a relative minimum at x0.
If n is even and f ðnÞ ðx0 Þ &lt; 0, then f has a relative maximum at x0.
If n is odd, then f has neither a relative minimum nor relative maximum at x0.

where c is some point between x0 and x. Since f (n) is continuous, if f ðnÞ ðx0 Þ 6¼ 0, then there
exists an interval U containing x0 such that f ðnÞ ðxÞ will have the same sign as f ðnÞ ðx0 Þ for
x 2 U. If x 2 U, then the point c also belongs to U and consequently f ðnÞ ðcÞ and f ðnÞ ðx0 Þ
will have the same sign.
f ðxÞ ¼ Pn#1 ðxÞ þ Rn#1 ðxÞ ¼ f ðx0 Þ þ

(i) If n is even and f ðnÞ ðx0 Þ &gt; 0, then for x 2 U we have f ðnÞ ðcÞ &gt; 0 and ðx # x0 Þn #
0 so that Rn#1 ðxÞ # 0. Hence, f ðxÞ # f ðx0 Þ for x 2 U, and therefore f has a relative
minimum at x0.
(ii) If n is even and f ðnÞ ðx0 Þ &lt; 0, then it follows that Rn#1 ðxÞ # 0 for x 2 U, so that
f ðxÞ # f ðx0 Þ for x 2 U. Therefore, f has a relative maximum at x0.
(iii) If n is odd, then ðx # x0 Þn is positive if x &gt; x0 and negative if x &lt; x0 . Consequently, if x 2 U, then Rn#1 ðxÞ will have opposite signs to the left and to the right of x0.
Therefore, f has neither a relative minimum nor a relative maximum at x0 .
Q.E.D.
Convex Functions
The notion of convexity plays an important role in a number of areas, particularly in the
modern theory of optimization. We shall briefly look at convex functions of one real
variable and their relation to differentiation. The basic results, when appropriately
modified, can be extended to higher dimensional spaces.
6.4.5 Definition Let I # R be an interval. A function f : I ! R is said to be convex on I
if for any t satisfying 0 # t # 1 and any points x1 ; x2 in I, we have
f ðð1 # tÞx1 þ tx2 Þ # ð1 # tÞ f ðx1 Þ þ tf ðx2 Þ:
Note that if x1 &lt; x2 , then as t ranges from 0 to 1, the point ð1 # tÞx1 þ tx2 traverses
the interval from x1 to x2 . Thus if f is convex on I and if x1 ; x2 2 I, then the chord joining
any two points ðx1 ; f ðx1 ÞÞ and ðx2 ; f ðx2 ÞÞ on the graph of f lies above the graph of f. (See
Figure 6.4.1.)

Figure 6.4.1

A convex function

A convex function need not be differentiable at every point, as the example
f ðxÞ :¼ jxj; x 2 R, reveals. However, it can be shown that if I is an open interval and if
f : I ! R is convex on I, then the left and right derivatives of f exist at every point of I. As a


C06

6.4 TAYLOR’S THEOREM

193

consequence, it follows that a convex function on an open interval is necessarily continuous.
We will not verify the preceding assertions, nor will we develop many other interesting
properties of convex functions. Rather, we will restrict ourselves to establishing the
connection between a convex function f and its second derivative f 00 , assuming that f 00 exists.
6.4.6 Theorem Let I be an open interval and let f : I ! R have a second derivative on
I. Then f is a convex function on I if and only if f 00 ðxÞ # 0 for all x 2 I.
Proof. ()) We will make use of the fact that the second derivative is given by the limit
f 00 ðaÞ ¼ lim

ð4Þ

h!0

f ða þ hÞ # 2f ðaÞ þ f ða # hÞ
h2

for each a 2 I. (See Exercise 16.) Given a 2 I, let h be such that a þ h and a # h belong to I.
Then a ¼ 12 ðða þ hÞ þ ða # hÞÞ, and since f is convex on I, we have
f ðaÞ ¼ f 12ða þ hÞ þ 12ða # hÞ # 12 f ða þ hÞ þ 12 f ða # hÞ:
Therefore, we have f ða þ hÞ # 2f ðaÞ þ f ða # hÞ # 0. Since h2 &gt; 0 for all h 6¼ 0, we see
that the limit in (4) must be nonnegative. Hence, we obtain f 00 ðaÞ # 0 for any a 2 I.
ð(Þ We will use Taylor’s Theorem. Let x1 ; x2 be any two points of I, let 0 &lt; t &lt; 1,
and let x0 :¼ ð1 # tÞx1 þ tx2 . Applying Taylor’s Theorem to f at x0 we obtain a point cl
between x0 and x1 such that
f ðx1 Þ ¼ f ðx0 Þ þ f 0 ðx0 Þðx1 # x0 Þ þ 12 f 00 ðc1 Þðx1 # x0 Þ2 ;
and a point c2 between x0 and x2 such that

If f 00 is nonnegative on I, then the term

Q.E.D.

Newton’s Method
It is often desirable to estimate a solution of an equation with a high degree of accuracy.
The Bisection Method, used in the proof of the Location of Roots Theorem 5.3.5, provides
one estimation procedure, but it has the disadvantage of converging to a solution rather
slowly. A method that often results in much more rapid convergence is based on the
geometric idea of successively approximating a curve by tangent lines. The method is
named after its discoverer, Isaac Newton.

from Rolle’s Theorem 6.2.3 that f does not vanish at any other point of I.

can be written in the form jKenþ1 j # jKen j2 . Consequently, if jKen j &lt; 10#m then
jKenþ1 j &lt; 10#2m so that the number of significant digits in Ken has been doubled. Because
of this doubling, the sequence generated by Newton’s Method is said to converge
‘‘quadratically.’’
(b) In practice, when Newton’s Method is programmed for a computer, one often makes
an initial guess x1 and lets the computer run. If x1 is poorly chosen, or if the root is too near
the endpoint of I, the procedure may not converge to a zero of f. Two possible difficulties

CHAPTER 7

THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

We have already mentioned the developments, during the 1630s, by Fermat and Descartes
leading to analytic geometry and the theory of the derivative. However, the subject we
know as calculus did not begin to take shape until the late 1660s when Isaac Newton
created his theory of ‘‘fluxions’’ and invented the method of ‘‘inverse tangents’’ to find
areas under curves. The reversal of the process for finding tangent lines to find areas was
also discovered in the 1680s by Gottfried Leibniz, who was unaware of Newton’s
unpublished work and who arrived at the discovery by a very different route. Leibniz
introduced the terminology ‘‘calculus differentialis’’ and ‘‘calculus integralis,’’ since
finding tangent lines involved differences and finding areas involved summations.
Thus, they had discovered that integration, being a process of summation, was inverse
to the operation of differentiation.
During a century and a half of development and refinement of techniques, calculus
consisted of these paired operations and their applications, primarily to physical problems.
In the 1850s, Bernhard Riemann adopted a new and different viewpoint. He separated the
concept of integration from its companion, differentiation, and examined the motivating
summation and limit process of finding areas by itself. He broadened the scope by
considering all functions on an interval for which this process of ‘‘integration’’ could
be defined: the class of ‘‘integrable’’ functions. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
became a result that held only for a restricted set of integrable functions. The viewpoint of
Riemann led others to invent other integration theories, the most significant being
Lebesgue’s theory of integration. But there have been some advances made in more
recent times that extend even the Lebesgue theory to a considerable extent. We will give a
brief introduction to these results in Chapter 10.

Bernhard Riemann
(Georg Friedrich) Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866), the son of a poor
Lutheran minister, was born near Hanover, Germany. To please his
father, he enrolled (1846) at the University of G€
ottingen as a student of
theology and philosophy, but soon switched to mathematics. He interrupted his studies at G€ottingen to study at Berlin under C. G. J. Jacobi,
P. G. J. Dirichlet, and F. G. Eisenstein, but returned to G€
ottingen in 1849
to complete his thesis under Gauss. His thesis dealt with what are now
called ‘‘Riemann surfaces.’’ Gauss was so enthusiastic about Riemann’s
work that he arranged for him to become a privatdozent at G€
ottingen in
1854. On admission as a privatdozent, Riemann was required to prove himself by delivering a
probationary lecture before the entire faculty. As tradition dictated, he submitted three topics, the
first two of which he was well prepared to discuss. To Riemann’s surprise, Gauss chose that he
should lecture on the third topic: ‘‘On the hypotheses that underlie the foundations of geometry.’’
After its publication, this lecture had a profound effect on modern geometry.
Despite the fact that Riemann contracted tuberculosis and died at the age of 39, he made
major contributions in many areas: the foundations of geometry, number theory, real and complex
analysis, topology, and mathematical physics.

7.1 RIEMANN INTEGRAL

199

We begin by defining the concept of Riemann integrability of real-valued functions
defined on a closed bounded interval of R, using the Riemann sums familiar to the reader
from calculus. This method has the advantage that it extends immediately to the case of
functions whose values are complex numbers, or vectors in the space R n. In Section 7.2, we
will establish the Riemann integrability of several important classes of functions: step
functions, continuous functions, and monotone functions. However, we will also see that
there are functions that are not Riemann integrable. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
is the principal result in Section 7.3. We will present it in a form that is slightly more
general than is customary and does not require the function to be a derivative at every point
of the interval. A number of important consequences of the Fundamental Theorem are also
given. In Section 7.3 we also give a statement of the definitive Lebesgue Criterion for
Riemann integrability. This famous result is usually not given in books at this level, since
its proof (given in Appendix C) is somewhat complicated. However, its statement is well
within the reach of students, who will also comprehend the power of this result. In Section
7.4, we discuss an alternative approach to the Riemann integral due to Gaston Darboux that
uses the concepts of upper integral and lower integral. The two approaches appear to be
quite different, but in fact they are shown to be equivalent. The final section presents
several methods of approximating integrals, a subject that has become increasingly
important during this era of high-speed computers. While the proofs of these results
are not particularly difficult, we defer them to Appendix D.
An interesting history of integration theory, including a chapter on the Riemann
integral, is given in the book by Hawkins cited in the References.

Section 7.1 Riemann Integral
We will follow the procedure commonly used in calculus courses and define the Riemann
integral as a kind of limit of the Riemann sums as the norm of the partitions tend to 0. Since we
assume that the reader is familiar—at least informally—with the integral from a calculus
course, we will not provide a motivation of the integral, or discuss its interpretation as the
‘‘area under the graph,’’ or its many applications to physics, engineering, economics, etc.
Instead, we will focus on the purely mathematical aspects of the integral.
However, we first define some basic terms that will be frequently used.
Partitions and Tagged Partitions
If I :¼ ½a; b# is a closed bounded interval in R, then a partition of I is a finite, ordered set
P :¼ ðx0 ; x1 ; . . . ; xn#1 ; xn Þ of points in I such that
a ¼ x0 &lt; x1 &lt; # # # &lt; xn#1 &lt; xn ¼ b:
(See Figure 7.1.1.) The points of P are used to divide I ¼ [a, b] into non-overlapping
subintervals
I 1 :¼ ½x0 ; x1 #;

I 2 :¼ ½x1 ; x2 #; . . . ;

CHAPTER 7 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Often we will denote the partition P by the notation P ¼ f½xi#1 ; xi #gni¼1 . We define the
norm (or mesh) of P to be the number
ð1Þ

jjPjj :¼ maxfx1 # x0 ; x2 # x1 ; . . . ; xn # xn#1 g:

Thus the norm of a partition is merely the length of the largest subinterval into which the
partition divides [a, b]. Clearly, many partitions have the same norm, so the partition is not
a function of the norm.
If a point ti has been selected from each subinterval I i ¼ ½xi#1 ; xi #, for i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n,
then the points are called tags of the subintervals I i . A set of ordered pairs
P_ :¼ fð½xi#1 ; xi #; ti Þgni¼1
of subintervals and corresponding tags is called a tagged partition of I; see Figure 7.1.2.
(The dot over the P indicates that a tag has been chosen for each subinterval.) The tags can
be chosen in a wholly arbitrary fashion; for example, we can choose the tags to be the left
endpoints, or the right endpoints, or the midpoints of the subintervals, etc. Note that an
endpoint of a subinterval can be used as a tag for two consecutive subintervals. Since each
tag can be chosen in infinitely many ways, each partition can be tagged in infinitely many
ways. The norm of a tagged partition is defined as for an ordinary partition and does not
depend on the choice of tags.

If P_ is the tagged partition given above, we define the Riemann sum of a function
f : ½a; b# ! R corresponding to P_ to be the number

We will also use this notation when P_ denotes a subset of a partition, and not the entire
partition.
The reader will perceive that if the function f is positive on [a, b], then the Riemann
sum (2) is the sum of the areas of n rectangles whose bases are the subintervals I i ¼
½xi#1 ; xi # and whose heights are f ðti Þ. (See Figure 7.1.3.)

Definition of the Riemann Integral
We now define the Riemann integral of a function f on an interval [a, b].
7.1.1 Definition A function f : ½a; b# ! R is said to be Riemann integrable on [a, b] if
there exists a number L 2 R such that for every e &gt; 0 there exists de &gt; 0 such that if P_ is
_ &lt; de , then
any tagged partition of [a, b] with jjPjj
# # ##
#
#S f ; P # L# &lt; e:
The set of all Riemann integrable functions on [a, b] will be denoted by R½a; b#.
Remark
#
# It is sometimes said that the integral# L is #‘‘the limit’’ of the Riemann sums
_ ! 0. However, since S f ; P_ is not a function of jjPjj,
_ this limit
S f : P_ as the norm jjPjj
is not of the type that we have studied before.
First we will show that if f 2 R½a; b#, then the number L is uniquely determined. It will
be called the Riemann integral of f over [a, b]. Instead of L, we will usually write
Z b
Z b
L¼
f or
f ðxÞdx:
a

a

It should be understood that any letter other than x can be used in the latter expression, so
long as it does not cause any ambiguity.
7.1.2 Theorem If f 2 R½a; b#, then the value of the integral is uniquely determined.
Proof. Assume that L0 and L00 both satisfy the definition and let e &gt; 0. Then there exists
d0e=2 &gt; 0 such that if P_ 1 is any tagged partition with jjP_ 1 jj &lt; d0e=2 , then
# #
#
#
#S f ; P_ 1 # L0 # &lt; e=2:
Also there exists d00e=2 &gt; 0 such that if P_ 2 is any tagged partition with jjP_ 2 jj &lt; d00e=2 , then
# # # #
#
#S f ; P 2 # L00 # &lt; e=2:
#
#
_ &lt; de . Since
Now let de :¼ min d0e=2 ; d00e=2 &gt; 0 and let P_ be a tagged partition with jjPjj
0
00
_ &lt; d e=2 , then
_ &lt; de=2 and jjPjj
both jjPjj
# # ##
#
# # ##
#
#S f ; P # L0 # &lt; e=2
#S f ; P # L00 # &lt; e=2;
and
whence it follows from the Triangle Inequality that
#
#

jL0 # L00 j ¼ #L0 # S f ; P þ S f ; P # L00 #
#
#
# # ## # # # #
# #L0 # S f ; P # þ #S f ; P # L00 #
&lt; e=2 þ e=2 ¼ e:
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, it follows that L0 ¼ L00 .

Q.E.D.

The next result shows that changing a function at a finite number of points does not
affect its integrability nor the value of its integral.

number of points in [a, b], then f is Riemann integrable and a f ¼ a g.

CHAPTER 7 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Proof. If we prove the assertion for the case of one exceptional point, then the extension
to a finite number of points is done by a standard induction argument, which we leave to the
reader.
Rb
Let c be a point in the interval and let L ¼ a g. Assume
# that
# f ðxÞ ¼
# gðxÞ# for all x 6¼ c.
_ the terms in the two sums S f ; P_ and S g; P_ are identical
For any tagged partition P,
with the exception of at most two terms (in the case that c ¼ xi ¼ xi#1 is an endpoint).
Therefore, we have
# # ##

##
#
#
#S f ; P # S g; P# # ¼ jSð f ðxi Þ # gðxi ÞÞðxi # xi#1 Þj # 2 jgðcÞjþj f ðcÞjÞ jjPjj:
Now, given e &gt; 0, we let#d1# &gt; 0 #satisfy# d1 &lt; e=ð4ðj f ðcÞj þ jgðcÞjÞ, and let d2 &gt; 0 be such
_ &lt; d2 implies #S g; P_ # L# &lt; e=2. We now let d :¼ minfd1 ; d2 g. Then, if
that jjPjj
_ &lt; d, we obtain
jjPjj

#
#
#
## # #
#
#S f ; P # L# # #S f ; P# # S g; P# # þ #S g; P# # L# &lt; e=2 þ e=2 ¼ e:
Hence, the function f is integrable with integral L.

Q.E.D.

Some Examples
If we use only the definition, in order to show that a function f is Riemann integrable we
must (i) know (or guess correctly) the value L of the integral, and (ii) construct a de that will
suffice for an arbitrary e &gt; 0. The determination of L is sometimes done by calculating
Riemann sums and guessing what L must be. The determination of de is likely to be
difficult.
In actual practice, we usually show that f 2 R½a; b# by making use of some of the
theorems that will be given later.
7.1.4 Examples (a) Every constant function on [a, b] is in R½a; b#.
Let f ðxÞ :¼ k for all x 2 ½a; b#. If P_ :¼ fð½xi#1 ; xi #; ti Þgni¼1 is any tagged partition of
[a, b], then it is clear that
n
# ## X
kðxi # xi#1 Þ ¼ kðb # aÞ:
S f; P ¼
i¼1

_ &lt; de , then
Hence, for any e &gt; 0, we can choose de :¼ 1 so that if jjPjj
# # ##
#
#S f ; P # kðb # aÞ# ¼ 0 &lt; e:
Rb
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that f 2 R½a; b# and a f ¼ kðb # aÞ.
(b) Let g : ½0; 3# ! R be defined by gðxÞ :¼ 2 for 0 # x # 1, and gðxÞ :¼ 3 for 1 &lt;
x # 3. A preliminary investigation,
based on the graph of g (see Figure 7.1.4), suggests
R3
that we might expect that 0 g ¼ 8.

Let P_ be a tagged
# partition
#
# of [0,3] with norm &lt; d; we will show how to determine d in
order to ensure that #S g; P_ #8j &lt; e. Let P_ 1 be the subset of P_ having its tags in [0,1]
where g(x) ¼ 2, and let P_ 2 be the subset of P_ with its tags in (1, 3] where g(x) ¼ 3. It is
obvious that we have
# ##
# # #
# # #
ð3Þ
S g; P ¼ S g; P 1 þ S g; P 2 :
If we let U 1 denote the union of the subintervals in P_ 1 , then it is readily shown that
ð4Þ

½0; 1 # d# # U 1 # ½0; 1 þ d#:

For example, to prove the first inclusion, we let u 2 ½0; 1 # d#. Then u lies in an interval
_ &lt; d, we have xk # xk#1 &lt; d. Then xk#1 # u #
I k :¼ ½xk#1 ; xk # of P_ 1 , and since jjPjj
1 # d implies that xk # xk#1 þ d # ð1 # dÞ þ d # 1. Thus the tag tk in I k satisfies tk # 1
and therefore u belongs to a subinterval whose tag is in [0,1], that is, u 2 U 1 . This proves the
first inclusion in (4), and the second inclusion can be shown in the same manner. Since
gðtk Þ ¼ 2 for the tags of P_ 1 and since the intervals in (4) have lengths 1 # d and 1 þ d,
respectively, it follows that
# # #
2ð1 # dÞ # S g; P 1 # 2ð1 þ dÞ:
A similar argument shows that the union of all subintervals with tags ti 2 ð1; 3# contains
the interval ½1 þ d; 3# of length 2 # d, and is contained in ½1 # d; 3# of length 2 þ d.
Therefore,
# # #
3ð2 # dÞ # S g; P 2 # 3ð2 þ dÞ:
Adding these inequalities and using equation (3), we have
# ##
# # #
# # #
8 # 5d # S g; P ¼ S g; P 1 þ S g; P 2 # 8 þ 5d;
whence it follows that

# # ##
#
#S g; P # 8# # 5d:

To have this final term &lt; e, we are led to take de &lt; e=5.
Making such a choice (for example, if we take de :¼ e=10), we can retrace the
# #
#
#
_ &lt; de . Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we have
argument and see that #S g; P_ # 8# &lt; e when jjPjj
R3
proved that g 2 R½0; 3# and that 0 g ¼ 8, as predicted,
(c) Let hðxÞ :¼ x for x 2 ½0; 1#; we will show that h 2 R½0; 1#.
We will employ a ‘‘trick’’ that enables us to guess the value of the integral by
considering a particular choice of the tag points. Indeed, if fI i gni¼1 is any partition of [0,1]
and we choose the tag of the interval I i ¼ ½xi#1 ; xi # to be the midpoint qi :¼ 12 ðxi#1 þ xi Þ,
then the contribution of this term to the Riemann sum corresponding to the tagged partition

then E ¼ f1; 1=2; 1=3; . . . ; 1=10g.) If n is the number of points in E, we allow for the
possibility that a tag may be counted twice if it is an endpoint and let d :¼ e=2n. For a given

tagged partition P_ such that jjPjj

Some Properties of the Integral
The difficulties involved in determining the value of the integral and of de suggest that it
would be very useful to have some general theorems. The first result in this direction
enables us to form certain algebraic combinations of integrable functions.

Boundedness Theorem
We now show that an unbounded function cannot be Riemann integrable.

that if P_ is any tagged partition of ½a; b# with jjPjj

Q.E.D.

We will close this section with an example of a function that is discontinuous at every
rational number and is not monotone, but is Riemann integrable nevertheless.
7.1.7 Example We consider Thomae’s function h : ½0; 1# ! R defined, as in Example 5.1.6(h), by hðxÞ :¼ 0 if x 2 ½0; 1# is irrational, hð0Þ :¼ 1 and by hðxÞ :¼ 1=n if x 2
½0; 1# is the rational number x ¼ m=n where m; n 2 N have no common integer factors
except 1. It was seen in 5.1.6(h) that h is continuous at every irrational number and
discontinuous at every rational number in [0, l]. See Figure 5.1.2. We will now show that
h 2 R½0; 1#.
For e &gt; 0, the set E :¼ fx 2 ½0; 1# : hðxÞ # e=2g is a finite set. (For example, if
e=2 ¼ 1=5, then there are eleven values of x such that hðxÞ # 1=5, namely,
E ¼ f0; 1; 1=2; 1=3; 2=3; 1=4; 3=4; 1=5; 2=5; 3=5; 4=5g. (Sketch a graph.) We let n
be the number of elements in E and take d :¼ e=ð4nÞ. If P_ is a given tagged partition such
_ &lt; d, then we separate P_ into two subsets. We let P_ 1 be the collection of tagged
that jjPjj
intervals in P_ that have their tags in E, and we let P_ 2 be the subset of tagged intervals in P_
that have their tags elsewhere in [0, 1]. Allowing for the possibility that a tag of P_ 1 may be
an endpoint of adjacent intervals, we see that P_ 1 has at most 2n intervals and the total
length of these intervals can be at most
# 2nd #¼ e=2. Also, we have 0 &lt; hðti Þ # 1 for each tag
ti in P_ 1 . Consequently, we have S h; P_ 1 # 1 # 2nd # e=2. For tags ti in P_ 2 , we have
_
hð#ti Þ &lt; e=2
# and the total length of the subintervals in P 2 is clearly less than 1, so that
S h; P_ 2 &lt; ðe=2Þ # 1 ¼ e=2. Therefore, combining these results, we get
# # #
# # #
# ##
0 # S h; P ¼ S h; P 1 þ S h; P 2 &lt; e=2 þ e=2 ¼ e:
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we infer that h 2 R½0; 1# with integral 0.

CHAPTER 7 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Section 7.2 Riemann Integrable Functions
We begin with a proof of the important Cauchy Criterion. We will then prove the Squeeze
Theorem, which will be used to establish the Riemann integrability of several classes of
functions (step functions, continuous functions, and monotone functions). Finally we will
establish the Additivity Theorem.
We have already noted that direct use of the definition requires that we know the value
of the integral. The Cauchy Criterion removes this need, but at the cost of considering two
Riemann sums, instead of just one.
7.2.1 Cauchy Criterion A function: ½a; b# ! R belongs to R½a; b# if and only if for

Evidently we may assume that dn # dnþ1 for n 2 N; otherwise, we replace dn by

For each n 2 N, let P_ n be a tagged partition with jjP_ n jj &lt; dn . Clearly, if m &gt; n then
both P_ m and P_ n have norms &lt; dn , so that

Consequently, the sequence S f ; P_ m m¼1 is a Cauchy sequence in# R. Therefore
(by

Theorem 3.5.5) this sequence converges in R and we let A :¼ limm S f ; P_ m .
Passing to the limit in (1) as m ! 1, we have

# # 10d:
In order to make this final term &lt; e, we are led to employ the Cauchy Criterion with
he :¼ e=20. (We leave the details to the reader.)
(b) The Cauchy Criterion can be used to show that a function f : ½a; b# ! R is not
Riemann integrable. To do this we need to show that: There exists e0 &gt; 0 such that for any
_ with jjPjj
_ &lt; h such that
_ &lt; h and jjQjj
h
partitions P_ and Q
# &gt;
#
# 0 there
#
#exists#tagged
_ # # e0 .
#S f ; P_ # S f ; Q
We will apply these remarks to the Dirichlet function, considered in 5.1.6(g), defined
by f ðxÞ :¼ 1 if x 2 ½0; 1# is rational and f ðxÞ :¼ 0 if x 2 ½0; 1# is irrational.

# Here
# we take e0 :¼ 2. If P is any partition all of whose tags are rational numbers then
_ is any tagged partition all of whose tags are irrational numbers
S f ; P_ # ¼ 1,# while if Q
_ ¼ 0. Since we are able to take such tagged partitions with arbitrarily small
then S f ; Q
&amp;
norms, we conclude that the Dirichlet function is not Riemann integrable.

The Squeeze Theorem
In working with the definition of Riemann integral, we have encountered two types of
difficulties. First, for each partition, there are infinitely many choices of tags. And second,
there are infinitely many partitions that have a norm less than a specified amount. We have
experienced dealing with these difficulties in examples and proofs of theorems. We will
now establish an important tool for proving integrability called the Squeeze Theorem that
will provide some relief from those difficulties. It states that if a given function can be
‘‘squeezed’’ or bracketed between two functions that are known to be Riemann integrable
with sufficient accuracy, then we may conclude that the given function is also Riemann
integrable. The exact conditions are given in the statement of the theorem. (The idea of
squeezing a function to establish integrability led the French mathematician Gaston
Darboux to develop an approach to integration by means of upper and lower integrals,
and this approach is presented in Section 7.4.)
7.2.3 Squeeze Theorem Let f : ½a; b# ! R. Then f 2 R½a; b# if and only if for every

Q.E.D.

Classes of Riemann Integrable Functions
The Squeeze Theorem is often used in connection with the class of step functions. It will be
recalled from Definition 5.4.9 that a function w : ½a; b# ! R is a step function if it has only
a finite number of distinct values, each value being assumed on one or more subintervals of
[a, b]. For illustrations of step functions, see Figures 5.4.3 or 7.1.4.
7.2.4 Lemma If J is a subinterval of [a, b] having endpoints c &lt; Rd and if wJ ðxÞ :¼ 1 for
b
x 2 J and wJ ðxÞ :¼ 0 elsewhere in [a, b], then wJ 2 R½a; b# and a wJ ¼ d # c.
Proof. If J ¼ ½c; d # with c # d, this is Exercise 7.1.13 and we can choose de :¼ e=4.
There are three other subintervals J having the same endpoints c and d, namely, [c, d ),
(c, d ], and (c, d ). Since, by Theorem 7.1.3, we can change the value of a function at finitely
many points without changing the integral, we have the same result for these other three
subintervals. Therefore, we conclude that all four functions wJ are integrable with integral
equal to d # c.
Q.E.D.
It is an important fact that any step function is Riemann integrable.
7.2.5 Theorem If w : ½a; b# ! R is a step function, then w 2 R½a; b#.
Proof. Step functions of the type appearing in 7.2.4 are called ‘‘elementary step
functions.’’ In Exercise 5 it is shown that an arbitrary step function w can be expressed

define the step functions an and vn on the disjoint subintervals ½0; 1=nÞ; ½1=n; 2=nÞ;
. . . ; ½ðn # 2Þ=nÞ; ðn # 1Þ=nÞ; ½ðn # 1Þ=n; 1# as follows: an ðxÞ :¼ hððk # 1Þ=nÞ ¼
ðk # 1Þ=n for x in ½ðk # 1Þ=n; k=nÞ for k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n # 1, and an ðxÞ :¼
hððn # 1Þ=nÞ ¼ ðn # 1Þ=n for x in ½ðn # 1Þ=n; 1#. That is, an has the minimum value
of h on each subinterval. Similarly, we define vn to be the maximum value of h on each
subinterval, that is, vn ðxÞ :¼ k=n for x in ½ðk # 1Þ=n; k=nÞ for k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n # 1, and
vn ðxÞ :¼ 1 for x in ½ðn # 1Þ=n; 1#. (The reader should draw a sketch for the case n ¼ 4.)

We will now use the Squeeze Theorem to show that an arbitrary continuous function is

CHAPTER 7 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

7.2.7 Theorem If f : ½a; b# ! R is continuous on [a, b], then f 2 R½a; b#.
Proof. It follows from Theorem 5.4.3 that f is uniformly continuous on [a, b]. Therefore,
given e &gt; 0 there exists de &gt; 0 such that if u; v 2 ½a; b# and ju # vj &lt; de , then we have
j f ðuÞ # f ðvÞj &lt; e=ðb # aÞ.
Let P ¼ fI i gni¼1 be a partition such that jjPjj &lt; de . Applying Theorem 5.3.4 we let
ui 2 I i be a point where f attains its minimum value on Ii, and let vi 2 I i be a point where f
attains its maximum value on I i .
Let ae be the step function defined by ae ðxÞ :¼ f ðui Þ for x 2 ½xi#1 ; xi Þ ði ¼ 1; . . . ;
n # 1Þ and ae ðxÞ :¼ f ðun Þ for x 2 ½xn#1 ; xn #. Let ve be defined similarly using the points vi

Monotone functions are not necessarily continuous at every point, but they are also
Riemann integrable.
7.2.8 Theorem If f : ½a; b# ! R is monotone on [a, b], then f 2 R½a; b#.
Proof. Assume that f is increasing on I ¼ ½a; b#. Partitioning the interval into n equal
subintervals I k ¼ ½xk#1 ; xk # gives us xk # xk#1 ¼ ðb # aÞ=n; k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n. Since f
is increasing on I k , its minimum value is attained at the left endpoint xk#1 and its
maximum value is attained at the right endpoint xk . Therefore, we define the step
functions aðxÞ :¼ f ðxk#1 Þ and vðxÞ :¼ f ðxk Þ for x 2 ½xk#1 ; xk Þ; k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n # 1, and
aðxÞ :¼ f ðxn#1 Þ and vðxÞ :¼ f ðxn Þ for x 2 ½xn#1 ; xn #. Then we have aðxÞ # f ðxÞ #

The Additivity Theorem
We now return to arbitrary Riemann integrable functions. Our next result shows that the
integral is an ‘‘additive function’’ of the interval over which the function is integrated.
This property is no surprise, but its proof is a bit delicate and may be omitted on a first
reading.
7.2.9 Additivity Theorem Let f :¼ ½a; b# ! R and let c 2 ða; bÞ. Then f 2 R½a; b# if

We note that the Additivity Theorem 7.2.9 implies that Lða; b; g Þ ¼ 0 when
a &lt; g &lt; b. But it is easily seen that both Lðb; g; aÞ and Lðg; a; bÞ equal Lða; b; g Þ.

Section 7.3 The Fundamental Theorem
We will now explore the connection between the notions of the derivative and the integral.
In fact, there are two theorems relating to this problem: one has to do with integrating a
derivative, and the other with differentiating an integral. These theorems, taken together,
are called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Roughly stated, they imply that the
operations of differentiation and integration are inverse to each other. However, there are
some subtleties that should not be overlooked.
The Fundamental Theorem (First Form)
The First Form of the Fundamental Theorem provides a theoretical basis for the method of
calculating an integral that the reader learned in calculus. It asserts that if a function
R b f is the
derivative of a function F, and if f belongs
to
R
½
a;
b
#,
then
the
integral
a f can be
#
calculated by means of the evaluation F #ba :¼ F ðbÞ # F ðaÞ. A function F such that F 0 ðxÞ ¼
f ðxÞ for all x 2 ½a; b# is called an antiderivative or a primitive of f on [a, b]. Thus, when f
has an antiderivative, it is a very simple matter to calculate its integral.
In practice, it is convenient to allow some exceptional points c where F 0 ðcÞ does not
exist in R, or where it does not equal f ðcÞ. It turns out that we can permit a finite number of
such exceptional points.
7.3.1 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (First Form) Suppose there is a finite set E
in [a, b] and functions f, F :¼ ½a; b# ! R such that:
(a) F is continuous on [a, b],
(b) F 0 ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ for all x 2 ½a; b#nE,
(c) f belongs to R½a; b#.
Then we have

f ¼ F ðbÞ # F ðaÞ:

be obtained by breaking the interval into the union of a finite number of intervals (see
Exercise 1).

7.3 THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

217

If the subintervals in P_ are ½xi#1 ; xi #, then the Mean Value Theorem 6.2.4 applied to F on
½xi#1 ; xi # implies that there exists ui 2 ðxi#1 ; xi Þ such that
F ðxi Þ # F ðxi#1 Þ ¼ F 0 ðui Þ # ðxi # xi#1 Þ

for

i ¼ 1; . . . ; n:

If we add these terms, note the telescoping of the sum, and use the fact that F 0 ðui Þ ¼ f ðui Þ,
we obtain

Now let P_ u :¼ fð#½xi#1 ; x#i #; ui Þgni¼1 , so the sum on the right equals S f ; P_ u . If we substitute

#
Z b #
#
#
# F ð bÞ # F ð aÞ #
f ## &lt; e:
#

But, since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we infer that equation (1) holds.

Q.E.D.

Remark If the function F is differentiable at every point of [a, b], then (by Theorem
6.1.2) hypothesis (a) is automatically satisfied. If f is not defined for some point c 2 E, we
take f ðcÞ :¼ 0. Even if F is differentiable at every point of [a, b], condition (c) is not
automatically satisfied, since there exist functions F such that F 0 is not Riemann
integrable. (See Example 7.3.2(e).)
7.3.2 Examples (a) If F ðxÞ :¼ 12 x2 for all x 2 ½a; b#, then F 0 ðxÞ ¼ x for all x 2 ½a; b#.
Further, f ¼ F 0 is continuous so it is in R½a; b#. Therefore the Fundamental Theorem (with
E ¼ ;) implies that
Z b
#
#
x dx ¼ F ðbÞ # F ðaÞ ¼ 12 b2 # a2 :
a

(b) If GðxÞ :¼ Arctan x for x 2 ½a; b#, then G0 ðxÞ ¼ 1=ðx2 þ 1Þ for all x 2 ½a; b#; also
G0 is continuous, so it is in R½a; b#. Therefore the Fundamental Theorem (with E ¼ ;)
implies that
Z b

dx ¼ Arctan b # Arctan a:
2þ1

a
(c) If AðxÞ :¼ jxj for x 2 ½#10; 10#, then A0 ðxÞ ¼ #1 if x 2 ½#10; 0Þ and A0 ðxÞ ¼ þ1 for
x 2 ð0; 10#. Recalling the definition of the signum function (in 4.1.10(b)), we have A0 ðxÞ ¼
sgnðxÞ for all x 2 ½#10; 10#nf0g. Since the signum function is a step function, it belongs
to R½#10; 10#. Therefore the Fundamental Theorem (with E ¼ f0g) implies that
Z 10
sgnðxÞ dx ¼ Að10Þ # Að#10Þ ¼ 10 # 10 ¼ 0:
#10

pﬃﬃﬃ
(d) If H ðxÞ :¼ 2 x for x 2 ½0; b#, then H is continuous on [0, b] and H 0 ðxÞ ¼ 1= x
for x 2 ð0; b#. Since h :¼ H 0 is not bounded on (0, b], it does not belong to R½0; b# no
matter how we define hð0Þ. Therefore, the Fundamental Theorem 7.3.1 does not apply.
(However, we will see in Example 10.1.10(a) that h is generalized Riemann integrable
on [0, b].)

Further, as in Example 6.1.7(e), it can be shown that K 0 ð0Þ ¼ 0. Thus K is continuous and
differentiable at every point of [0, 1]. Since it can be seen that the function K 0 is not
bounded on [0, 1], it does not belong to R½0; 1# and the Fundamental Theorem 7.3.1 does
not apply to K 0 . (However, we will see from Theorem 10.1.9 that K 0 is generalized Riemann
&amp;
integrable on [0, 1].)

The Fundamental Theorem (Second Form)
We now turn to the Fundamental Theorem (Second Form) in which we wish to differentiate
an integral involving a variable upper limit.
7.3.3 Definition If f 2 R½a; b#, then the function defined by
Z z
ð3Þ
F ðzÞ :¼
f
for
z 2 ½a; b#;
a

is called the indefinite integral of f with basepoint a. (Sometimes a point other than a is
used as a basepoint; see Exercise 6.)
We will first show that if f 2 R½a; b#, then its indefinite integral F satisfies a Lipschitz
condition; hence F is continuous on [a, b].
7.3.4 Theorem The indefinite integral F defined by (3) is continuous on [a, b]. In fact, if
j f ðxÞj # M for all x 2 ½a; b#, then jF ðzÞ # F ðw Þj # M jz # w j for all z; w 2 ½a; b#.

7.3 THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

219

7.3.5 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Second Form) Let f 2 R½a; b# and let f be
continuous at a point c 2 ½a; b# . Then the indefinite integral, defined by (3), is differentiable at c and F 0 ðcÞ ¼ f ðcÞ.
Proof. We will suppose that c 2 ½a; bÞ and consider the right-hand derivative of
F at c. Since f is continuous at c, given e &gt; 0 there exists he &gt; 0 such that if
c # x &lt; c þ he , then
ð4Þ

f ðcÞ # e &lt; f ðxÞ &lt; f ðcÞ þ e:

Let h satisfy 0 &lt; h &lt; he. The Additivity Theorem 7.2.9 implies that f is integrable on the
intervals ½a; c#; ½a; c þ h# and ½c; c þ h# and that
Z cþh
f:
F ðc þ hÞ # F ðcÞ ¼
c

Now on the interval ½c; c þ h# the function f satisfies inequality (4), so that we have
Z cþh
f # ð f ðcÞ þ eÞ # h:
ð f ðcÞ # eÞ # h # F ðc þ hÞ # F ðcÞ ¼
c

If we divide by h &gt; 0 and subtract f ðcÞ, we obtain
#
#
# F ð c þ hÞ # F ð c Þ
#
#
# f ðcÞ## # e:
#
h
But, since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that the right-hand limit is given by
lim

x!0þ

F ð c þ hÞ # F ð c Þ
¼ f ðcÞ:
h

It is proved in the same way that the left-hand limit of this difference quotient also equals
f ðcÞ when c 2 ða; b#, whence the assertion follows.
Q.E.D.
If f is continuous on all of [a, b], we obtain the following result.
7.3.6 Theorem If f is continuous on [a, b], then the indefinite integral F, defined by (3),
is differentiable on [a, b] and F 0 ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ for all x 2 ½a; b#.
Theorem 7.3.6 can be summarized: If f is continuous on [a, b], then its indefinite
integral is an antiderivative of f. We will now see that, in general, the indefinite integral
need not be an antiderivative (either because the derivative of the indefinite integral does
not exist or does not equal f ðxÞ).
7.3.7 Examples (a) If f ðxÞ :¼ sgn x on ½#1; 1#, then f 2 R½#1; 1# and has the
indefinite integral F ðxÞ :¼ jxj # 1 with the basepoint #1. However, since F 0 ð0Þ does
not exist, F is not an antiderivative of f on ½#1; 1#.
(b) If h Rdenotes Thomae’s function, considered in 7.1.7, then its indefinite integral
x
H ðxÞ :¼ 0 h is identically 0 on [0, 1]. Here, the derivative of this indefinite integral exists
at every point and H 0 ðxÞ ¼ 0. But H 0 ðxÞ 6¼ hðxÞ whenever x 2 Q \ ½0; 1#, so that H is not
&amp;
an antiderivative of h on [0, 1].

CHAPTER 7 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Substitution Theorem
The next theorem provides the justification for the ‘‘change of variable’’ method that is
often used to evaluate integrals. This theorem is employed (usually implicitly) in the
evaluation by means of procedures that involve the manipulation of ‘‘differentials,’’
common in elementary courses.
7.3.8 Substitution Theorem Let J :¼ ½a; b# and let w : J ! R have a continuous
derivative on J. If f : I ! R is continuous on an interval I containing wðJ Þ, then

The proof of this theorem is based on the Chain Rule 6.1.6, and will be outlined in
Exercise 17. The hypotheses that f and w0 are continuous are restrictive, but are used to
ensure the existence of the Riemann integral on the left side of (5).

Here we substitute wðtÞ :¼ t for t 2 ½1; 4# so that w0 ðtÞ ¼ 1= 2 t is continuous on
[1, 4]. If we let f ðxÞ :¼ 2 sin x, then the integrand has theR form ð f wÞ # w0 and the

Substitution Theorem 7.3.8 implies that the integral equals 1 2 sin x dx ¼ #2 cos xj21 ¼
2ðcos 1 # cos 2Þ.

(b) Consider the integral

Since wðtÞ :¼ t does not have a continuous derivative on [0, 4], the Substitution
Theorem 7.3.8 is not applicable, at least with this substitution. (In fact, it is not obvious that
this integral exists; however, we can apply Exercise 7.2.11 to obtainpthis
ﬃﬃ conclusion. We
could then apply the Fundamental Theorem 7.3.1 to F ðtÞ :¼ #2 cos t with E :¼ f0g to
&amp;
evaluate this integral.)
We will give a more powerful Substitution Theorem for the generalized Riemann
integral in Section 10.1.
Lebesgue’s lntegrability Criterion
We will now present a statement of the definitive theorem due to Henri Lebesgue
(1875–1941) giving a necessary and sufficient condition for a function to be Riemann
integrable, and will give some applications of this theorem. In order to state this result,
we need to introduce the important notion of a null set.
Warning Some people use the term ‘‘null set’’ as a synonym for the terms ‘‘empty set’’
or ‘‘void set’’ referring to ; (¼ the set that has no elements). However, we will always use
the term ‘‘null set’’ in conformity with our next definition, as is customary in the theory of
integration.
7.3.10 Definition (a) A set Z # R is said to be a null set if for every e &gt; 0 there exists a
countable collection fðak ; bk Þg1

7.3 THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

221

(b) If Q(x) is a statement about the point x 2 I, we say that Q(x) holds almost everywhere on I (or for almost every x 2 I), if there exists a null set Z # I such that Q(x)
holds for all x 2 InZ. In this case we may write
QðxÞ

for a:e:

x 2 I:

It is trivial that any subset of a null set is also a null set, and it is easy to see that the
union of two null sets is a null set. We will now give an example that may be very
surprising.
7.3.11 Example The Q 1 of rational numbers in [0, 1] is a null set.
We enumerate Q 1 ¼ fr1 ; r2 ; . . .g. Given e &gt; 0, note that the open interval J 1 :¼
ðr1 # e=4; r1 þ e=4Þ contains r1 and has length e=2; also the open interval J 2 :¼ ðr2 #
e=8; r2 þ e=8) contains r2 and has length e=4. In general, the open interval
#
#
e
e
J k :¼ rk # kþ1 ; rk þ kþ1
2
2
S
contains the point rk and has length e=2k . Therefore, the union 1
k¼1 J k of these open
1 #
X
#
intervals contains every point of Q 1 ; moreover, the sum of the lengths is
e=2k ¼ e.
&amp;
k¼1
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, Q 1 is a null set.
The argument just given can be modified to show that: Every countable set is a null set.
However, it can be shown that there exist uncountable null sets in R; for example, the
Cantor set that will be introduced in Definition 11.1.10.
We now state Lebesgue’s Integrability Criterion. It asserts that a bounded function on
an interval is Riemann integrable if and only if its points of discontinuity form a null set.
7.3.12 Lebesgue’s Integrability Criterion A bounded function f : ½a; b# ! R is
Riemann integrable if and only if it is continuous almost everywhere on [a, b].
A proof of this result will be given in Appendix C. However, we will apply Lebesgue’s
Theorem here to some specific functions, and show that some of our previous results follow
immediately from it. We shall also use this theorem to obtain the important Composition
and Product Theorems.
7.3.13 Examples (a) The step function g in Example 7.1.4(b) is continuous at every
point except the point x ¼ 1. Therefore it follows from the Lebesgue Integrability Criterion
that g is Riemann integrable.
In fact, since every step function has at most a finite set of points of discontinuity, then:
Every step function on [a, b] is Riemann integrable.
(b) Since it was seen in Theorem 5.6.4 that the set of points of discontinuity of a monotone
function is countable, we conclude that: Every monotone function on [a, b] is Riemann
integrable.
(c) The function G in Example 7.1.4(d) is discontinuous precisely at the points D :¼
f1; 1=2; . . . ; 1=n; . . .g. Since this is a countable set, it is a null set and Lebesgue’s Criterion
implies that G is Riemann integrable.
(d) The Dirichlet function was shown in Example 7.2.2(b) not to be Riemann integrable.
Note that it is discontinuous at every point of [0, 1]. Since it can be shown that the
interval [0, 1] is not a null set, Lebesgue’s Criterion yields the same conclusion.

CHAPTER 7 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

(e) Let h : ½0; 1# ! R be Thomae’s function, defined in Examples 5.1.6(h) and 7.l.7.
In Example 5.1.6(h), we saw that h is continuous at every irrational number and is
discontinuous at every rational number in [0, 1]. By Example 7.3.11, it is discontinuous on
a null set, so Lebesgue’s Criterion implies that Thomae’s function is Riemann integrable on
&amp;
[0, 1], as we saw in Example 7.1.7.
We now obtain a result that will enable us to take other combinations of Riemann
integrable functions.
7.3.14 Composition Theorem Let f 2 R½a; b# with f ð½a; b#Þ # ½c; d # and let w :
½c; d # ! R be continuous. Then the composition w f belongs to R½a; b#.
Proof. If f is continuous at a point u 2 ½a; b#, then w f is also continuous at u. Since the
set D of points of discontinuity of f is a null set, it follows that the set D1 # D of points of
discontinuity of w f is also a null set. Therefore the composition w f also belongs to
R½a; b#.
Q.E.D.
It will be seen in Exercise 22 that the hypothesis that w is continuous cannot be
dropped. The next result is a corollary of the Composition Theorem.
7.3.15 Corollary Suppose that f 2 R½a; b#. Then its absolute value j f j is in R½a; b#, and

f ## #

#

where j f ðxÞj # M for all x 2 ½a; b#.
Proof. We have seen in Theorem 7.1.6 that if f is integrable, then there exists M such that
j f ðxÞj # M for all x 2 ½a; b#. Let wðtÞ :¼ jtj for t 2 ½#M; M #; then the Composition
Theorem implies that j f j ¼ w f 2 R½a; b#. The first inequality follows from the fact that
#j f j # f # j f j and 7.1.5(c), and the second from the fact that j f ðxÞj # M.
Q.E.D.
7.3.16 The Product Theorem If f and g belong to R½a; b#, then the product fg belongs
to R½a; b#.
Proof. If wðtÞ :¼ t2 for t 2 ½#M; M #, it follows from the Composition Theorem that
f 2 ¼ w f belongs to R½a; b#. Similarly, ð f þ gÞ2 and g2 belong to R½a; b#. But since we
can write the product as
i
1h
f g ¼ ð f þ gÞ 2 # f 2 # g2 ;

it follows that f g 2 R½a; b#.

Integration by Parts
We will conclude this section with a rather general form of Integration by Parts for the
Riemann integral, and Taylor’s Theorem with the Remainder.

Section 7.4 The Darboux Integral
An alternative approach to the integral is due to the French mathematician Gaston Darboux
(1842–1917). Darboux had translated Riemann’s work on integration into French for
publication in a French journal and inspired by a remark of Riemann, he developed a
treatment of the integral in terms of upper and lower integrals that was published in 1875.
Approximating sums in this approach are obtained from partitions using the infima and
suprema of function values on subintervals, which need not be attained as function values
and thus the sums need not be Riemann sums.
This approach is technically simpler in the sense that it avoids the complications of
working with infinitely many possible choices of tags. But working with infima and
suprema also has its complications, such as lack of additivity of these quantities. Moreover,
the reliance on the order properties of the real numbers causes difficulties in extending the
Darboux integral to higher dimensions, and, more importantly, impedes generalization to
more abstract surfaces such as manifolds. Also, the powerful Henstock-Kurzweil approach
to integration presented in Chapter 10, which includes the Lebesgue integral, is based on
the Riemann definition as given in Section 7.1.
In this section we introduce the upper and lower integrals of a bounded function on an
interval, and define a function to be Darboux integrable if these two quantities are equal.
We then look at examples and establish a Cauchy-like integrability criterion for the
Darboux integral. We conclude the section by proving that the Riemann and Darboux
approaches to the integral are in fact equivalent, that is, a function on a closed, bounded
interval is Riemann integrable if and only if it is Darboux integrable. Later topics in the
book do not depend on the Darboux definition of integral so that this section can be
regarded as optional.
Upper and Lower Sums
Let f : I ! R be a bounded function on I ¼ ½a; b# and let P ¼ ðx0 ; x1 ; . . . ; xn Þ be a
partition of I. For k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n we let

the lower sum is less than or equal to the upper sum. We now show this to be the case.

If P :¼ ðx0 ; x1 ; . . . ; xn Þ and Q :¼ ðy0 ; y1 ; . . . ; ym Þ are partitions of I, we say that Q is a
refinement of P if each partition point xk 2 P also belongs to Q (that is, if P # Q). A
refinement Q of a partition P can be obtained by adjoining a finite number of points to P. In
this case, each one of the intervals ½xk#1 ; xk # into which P divides I can be written as the
union of intervals whose end points belong to Q; that is,
½xk#1 ; xk # ¼ yj#1 ; yj [ yj ; yjþ1 [ # # # [ ½yh#1 ; yh #:
We now show that refining a partition increases lower sums and decreases upper sums.

m0k :¼ inf f f ðxÞ : x 2 ½xk#1 ; z#g;

m00k :¼ inf f f ðxÞ : x 2 ½z; xk #g:

Then mk # m0k and mk # m00k (why?) and therefore
mk ðxk # xk#1 Þ ¼ mk ðz # xk#1 Þ þ mk ðxk # zÞ # m0k ðz # xk#1 Þ þ m00k ðxk # zÞ:
#
#
If we add the terms mj xj # xj#1 for j 6¼ k to the above inequality, we obtain
Lð f ; P Þ # L ð f ; P 0 Þ.
Now if Q is any refinement of P (i.e., if P # Q), then Q can be obtained from P by
adjoining a finite number of points to P one at a time. Hence, repeating the preceding
argument, we infer that Lð f ; P Þ # Lð f ; QÞ.
Upper sums are handled similarly; we leave the details as an exercise.
Q.E.D.
These two results are now combined to conclude that a lower sum is always smaller
than an upper sum even if they correspond to different partitions.
7.4.3 Lemma Let f : I ! R be bounded. If P 1 ; P 2 are any two partitions of I, then
Lð f ; P 1 Þ # U ð f ; P 2 Þ.
Proof. Let Q :¼ P 1 [ P 2 be the partition obtained by combining the points of P 1 and P 2 .
Then Q is a refinement of both P 1 and P 2 . Hence, by Lemmas 7.4.1 and 7.4.2, we conclude
that
Lð f ; P 1 Þ # Lð f ; QÞ # U ð f ; QÞ # U ð f ; P 2 Þ:

Q.E.D.

Upper and Lower Integrals
We shall denote the collection of all partitions of the interval I by PðI Þ. If f : I ! R is
bounded, then each P in PðI Þ determines two numbers: Lð f ; P Þ and U ð f ; P Þ. Thus, the
collection PðI Þ determines two sets of numbers: the set of lower sums Lð f ; P Þ for
P 2 PðI Þ, and the set of upper sums U ð f ; P Þ for P 2 PðI Þ. Hence, we are led to the
following definitions.
7.4.4 Definition Let I :¼ ½a; b# and let f : I ! R be a bounded function. The lower
integral of f on I is the number
Lð f Þ :¼ supfLð f ; P Þ : P 2 PðI Þg;
and the upper integral of f on I is the number
U ð f Þ :¼ inf fU ð f ; P Þ : P 2 PðI Þg:
Since f is a bounded function, we are assured of the existence of the numbers
mI :¼ inf f f ðxÞ : x 2 I g and

M I :¼ supf f ðxÞ : x 2 I g:

It is readily seen that for any P 2 PðI Þ, we have
mI ðb # aÞ # Lð f ; P Þ # U ð f ; P Þ # M I ðb # aÞ:
Hence it follows that

CHAPTER 7 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

7.4.5 Theorem Let I ¼ ½a; b# and let f : I ! R be a bounded function. Then the lower
integral Lð f Þ and the upper integral U ð f Þ of f on I exist. Moreover,
ð2Þ

Lð f Þ # U ð f Þ:

Proof. If P 1 and P 2 are any partitions of I, then it follows from Lemma 7.4.3 that
Lð f ; P 1 Þ # U ð f ; P 2 Þ. Therefore the number U ð f ; P 2 Þ is an upper bound for the set
fLð f ; P Þ : P 2 PðI Þg. Consequently, Lð f Þ, being the supremum of this set, satisfies
Lð f Þ # U ð f ; P 2 Þ. Since P 2 is an arbitrary partition of I, then Lð f Þ is a lower bound for the
set fU ð f ; P Þ : P 2 PðI Þg. Consequently, the infimum U ð f Þ of this set satisfies the
inequality (2).
Q.E.D.

The Darboux Integral
If I is a closed bounded interval and f : I ! R is a bounded function, we have proved in
Theorem 7.4.5 that the lower integral Lð f Þ and the upper integral U ð f Þ always exist.
Moreover, we always have Lð f Þ # U ð f Þ. However, it is possible that we might have
Lð f Þ &lt; U ð f Þ, as we will see in Example 7.4.7(d). On the other hand, there is a large class
of functions for which Lð f Þ ¼ U ð f Þ.
7.4.6 Definition Let I ¼ ½a; b# and let f : I ! R be a bounded function. Then f is said
to be Darboux integrable on I if Lð f Þ ¼ U ð f Þ. In this case the Darboux integral of f over
I is defined to be the value Lð f Þ ¼ U ð f Þ.
Thus we see that if the Darboux integral of a function on an interval exists, then the
integral is the unique real number that lies between the lower sums and the upper sums.
Since we will soon establishRthe equivalence
of the Darboux and Riemann integrals,
Rb
b
we will use the standard notation a f or a f ðxÞ dx for the Darboux integral of a function
f on ½a; b#. The context should prevent any confusion from arising.
7.4.7 Examples (a) A constant function is Darboux integrable.
Let f ðxÞ :¼ c for x 2 I :¼ ½a; b#. If P is any partition of I, it is easy to see that
Lð f ; P Þ ¼ cðb # aÞ ¼ U ð f ; P Þ (See Exercise 7.4.2). Therefore the lower and upper
integrals

(b) Let g be defined on [0, 3] as follows: gðxÞ :¼ 2 if 0 # x # 1 and gðxÞ :¼ 3 if
2 &lt; x # 3. (See Example 7.1.4(b).) For e &gt; 0, if we define the partition
P e :¼ ð0; 1; 1 þ e; 3Þ, then we get the upper sum
U ðg; P e Þ ¼ 2 # ð1 # 0Þ þ 3ð1 þ e # 1Þ þ 3ð2 # eÞ ¼ 2 þ 3e þ 6 # 3e ¼ 8:
Therefore, the upper integral satisfies U ðgÞ # 8. (Note that we cannot yet claim
equality because U ðgÞ is the infimum over all partitions of [0, 3].) Similarly, we get
the lower sum
Lðg; P e Þ ¼ 2 þ 2e þ 3ð2 # eÞ ¼ 8 # e;
so that the lower integral satisfies LðgÞ # 8. Then we haveR8 # LðgÞ # U ðgÞ # 8, and
3
hence LðgÞ ¼ U ðgÞ ¼ 8. Thus the Darboux integral of g is 0 g ¼ 8.

Lðh; P n Þ ¼ ð0 þ 1 þ # # # þ ðn # 1ÞÞ=n2 ; U ðh; P n Þ ¼ ð1 þ 2 þ # # # þ nÞ=n2 :

If P :¼ ðx0 ; x1 ; . . . ; xn Þ is any partition of [0, 1], then since every nontrivial interval contains
both rational numbers and irrational numbers (see the Density Theorem 2.4.8 and its
corollary), we have mk ¼ 0 and M k ¼ 1. Therefore, we have Lð f ; P Þ ¼ 0; U ð f ; P Þ ¼ 1;
for all P 2 PðI Þ, so that Lð f Þ ¼ 0; U ð f Þ ¼ 1: Since Lð f Þ 6¼ U ð f Þ, the function f is not
Darboux integrable on [0, 1].
We now establish some conditions for the existence of the integral.
7.4.8 Integrability Criterion Let I :¼ ½a; b# and let f : I ! R be a bounded function

ð3Þ

U ð f ; P e Þ # Lð f ; P e Þ &lt; e:

Proof. If f is integrable, then we have Lð f Þ ¼ U ð f Þ. If e &gt; 0 is given, then from the
definition of the lower integral as a supremum, there is a partition P 1 of I such that Lð f Þ #
e=2 &lt; Lð f ; P 1 Þ: Similarly, there is a partition P 2 of I such that U ð f ; P 2 Þ &lt; U ð f Þ þ e=2:
If we let P e :¼ P 1 [ P 2 , then P e is a refinement of both P 1 and P 2 . Consequently, by

Lð f Þ # e=2 &lt; Lð f ; P 1 Þ # Lð f ; Pe Þ
# U ð f ; P e Þ # U ð f ; P 2 Þ &lt; U ð f Þ þ e=2:
Since Lð f Þ ¼ U ð f Þ, we conclude that (3) holds.
To establish the converse, we first observe that for any partition P we have
Lð f ; P Þ # Lð f Þ and U ð f Þ # U ð f ; P Þ. Therefore,
U ð f Þ # Lð f Þ # U ð f ; P Þ # Lð f ; P Þ:
Now suppose that for each e &gt; 0 there exists a partition P e such that (3) holds.
Then we have
U ð f Þ # Lð f Þ # U ð f ; P e Þ # Lð f ; P e Þ &lt; e:
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that U ð f Þ # Lð f Þ. Since the inequality Lð f Þ # U ð f Þ
is always valid, we have Lð f Þ ¼ U ð f Þ. Hence f is Darboux integrable.

then f is integrable and lim Lð f ; P n Þ ¼ a f ¼ limn U ð f ; P n Þ.

Proof. If e &gt; 0 is given, it follows from the hypothesis that there exists K such that if
n # K then U ð f ; P n Þ # Lð f ; P n Þ &lt; e, whence the integrability of f follows from the
Integrability Criterion. We leave the remainder of the proof as an exercise.
Q.E.D.
The significance of the corollary is the fact that although the definition of the Darboux
integral involves the set of all possible partitions of an interval, for a given function, the
existence of the integral and its value can often be determined by a special sequence of
partitions.

Continuous and Monotone Functions
It was shown in Section 7.2 that functions that are continuous or monotone on a closed
bounded interval are Riemann integrable. (See Theorems 7.2.7 and 7.2.8.) The proofs
employed approximation by step functions and the Squeeze Theorem 7.2.3 as the main
tools. Both proofs made essential use of the fact that both continuous functions and
monotone functions attain a maximum value and a minimum value on a closed bounded
interval. That is, if f is a continuous or monotone function on [a, b], then for a partition
P ¼ ðx0 ; x1 ; . . . ; xn Þ, the numbers M k ¼ supf f ðxÞ : x 2 I k g and mk ¼ inf f f ðxÞ : x 2 I k g,
k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n, are attained as function values. For continuous functions, this is Theorem
5.3.4, and for monotone functions, these values are attained at the right and left endpoints
of the interval.
If we define the step function v on [a, b] by vðxÞ :¼ M k for x 2 ½xk#1 ; xk Þ for
k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n # 1, and vðxÞ :¼ M n for x 2 ½xn#1 ; xn #, then we observe that the Riemann

We thus see that the Integrability Criterion 7.4.8 is the Darboux integral counterpart to the
Squeeze Theorem 7.2.3 for the Riemann integral.
Therefore, if we examine the proofs of Theorems 7.2.7 and 7.2.8 that establish the
Riemann integrability of continuous and monotone functions, respectively, and replace the
integrals of step functions by the corresponding lower and upper sums, then we obtain
proofs of the theorems for the Darboux integral. (For example, in Theorem 7.2.7 for
continuous functions, we would have ae ðxÞ ¼ f ðui Þ ¼ mi and ve ðxÞ ¼ f ðvi Þ ¼ M i and
replace the integral of ve # ae with U ð f ; P Þ # Lð f ; P Þ:)
Thus we have the following theorem. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to write
out the proof.
7.4.10 Theorem If the function f on the interval I ¼ [a, b] is either continuous or
monotone on I, then f is Darboux integrable on I.
The preceding observation that connects the Riemann and Darboux integrals plays a
role in the proof of the equivalence of the two approaches to integration, which we now
discuss. Of course, once equivalence has been established, then the preceding theorem
would be an immediate consequence.

Equivalence
We conclude this section with a proof that the Riemann and Darboux definitions of the
integral are equivalent in the sense that a function on a closed, bounded interval is Riemann
integrable if and only if it is Darboux integrable, and their integrals are equal. This is not
immediately apparent. The Riemann integral is defined in terms of sums that use function
values (tags) together with a limiting process based on the length of subintervals in a
partition. On the other hand, the Darboux integral is defined in terms of sums that use
infima and suprema of function values, which need not be function values, and a limiting
process based on refinement of partitions, not the size of subintervals in a partition. Yet the
two are equivalent.
The background needed to prove equivalence is at hand. For example, if a function is
Darboux integrable, we recognize that upper and lower Darboux sums are Riemann
integrals of step functions. Thus the Integrability Criterion 7.4.8 for the Darboux integral

CHAPTER 7 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

corresponds to the Squeeze Theorem 7.2.3 for the Riemann integral in its application. In
the other direction, if a function is Riemann integrable, the definitions of supremum and
infimum enable us to choose tags to obtain Riemann sums that are as close to upper and
lower Darboux sums as we wish. In this way, we connect the Riemann integral to the upper
and lower Darboux integrals. The details are given in the proof.
7.4.11 Equivalence Theorem A function f on I ¼ [a, b] is Darboux integrable if and
only if it is Riemann integrable.
Proof. Assume that f is Darboux integrable. For e &gt; 0, let P e be a partition of [a, b] such
that U ð f ; P e Þ # Lð f ; P e Þ &lt; e. For this partition, as in the preceding discussion, we define
the step functions ae and ve on [a, b] by ae ðxÞ :¼ mk and ve ðxÞ :¼ M k for
x 2 ½xk#1 ; xk Þ; k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n # 1, and ae ðxÞ :¼ mn ; ve ðxÞ :¼ M n for x 2 ½xn#1 ; xn #,
where, as usual, M k is the supremum and mk the infimum of f on I k ¼ ½xk#1 ; xk #. Clearly
we have
ð4Þ

ae ðxÞ # f ðxÞ # ve ðxÞ for all x in ½a; b#:

By the Squeeze Theorem 7.2.3, it follows that f is Riemann integrable. Moreover, we note
that (4) and (5) are valid for any partition P and therefore the Riemann integral of f lies
between Lð f ; P Þ and U ð f ; P Þ for any partition P. Therefore the Riemann integral of f is
equal to the Darboux integral of f.

Now assume that f is Riemann integrable and let A ¼ a f denote the value of the
integral. Then, f is bounded by Theorem 7.1.6, and# given

and hence we have U ð f Þ &lt; A þ 2e. Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, this implies that U ð f Þ # A.
In the same manner, we can approximate lower sums by Riemann sums and show that
Lð f Þ &gt; A # 2e for arbitrary e &gt; 0, which implies Lð f Þ # A. Thus we have
R b obtained the
inequality A # Lð f Þ # U ð f Þ # A, which gives us Lð f Þ ¼ U ð f Þ ¼ A ¼ a f . Hence, the
function f is Darboux integrable with value equal to the Riemann integral.

Fundamental Theorem. Nevertheless, when
R b f is continuous, there are a number of techniques
for approximating the Riemann integral a f by using sums that resemble

If the integrals of g and h can be calculated, then we have bounds for a f. Often these
bounds are accurate enough for our needs.

Consequently, we have 1 # 1=e # 0 e#x dx # 1. If we use the mean of the bracketing
values, we obtain the estimate 1 # 1=2e 0:816 for the integral with an error less than
1=2e &lt; 0:184. This estimate is crude, but it is obtained rapidly and may be quite
satisfactory for our needs. If a better approximation is desired, we can attempt to find
closer approximating functions g and h.
2
Taylor’s Theorem 6.4.1 can be used to approximate e#x by a polynomial. In using
Taylor’s Theorem, we must get bounds on the remainder term for our calculations to have
significance. For example, if we apply Taylor’s Theorem to e#y for 0 # y # 1, we get
2

e#y ¼ 1 # y þ y2 # y3 þ R3 ;

where R3 ¼ y4 e#c =24 where c is some number with 0 # c # 1. Since we have no better
information as to the location of c, we must be content with the estimate 0 # R3 # y4 =24.
Hence we have

e#x ¼ 1 # x2 þ x4 # x6 þ R3 ;

Equal Partitions
If f : ½a; b# ! R is continuous, we know that its Riemann integral exists. To find an
approximate value for this integral with the minimum amount of calculation, it is
convenient to consider partitions P n of ½a; b# into n equal subintervals having length
hn :¼ ðb # aÞ=n. Hence P n is the partition:
a &lt; a þ hn &lt; a þ 2hn &lt; # # # &lt; a þ nhn ¼ b:
If we pick our tag points to be the left endpoints and the right endpoints of the subintervals,
we obtain the nth left approximation given by
Ln ð f Þ :¼ hn

and the nth right approximation given by
Rn ð f Þ :¼ hn

n

f ða þ khn Þ:

k¼1

It should be noted that it is almost as easy to evaluate both of these approximations as only
one of them, since they differ only by the terms f(a) and f(b).
Unless we have reason to believe that one of Ln ð f Þ or Rn ð f Þ is closer to the actual value
of the integral than the other one, we generally take their mean:
1
ðLn ð f Þ þ Rn ð f ÞÞ;

which is readily seen to equal

However, we note that if f is increasing on [a, b], then it is clear from a sketch of the
graph of f that

An error estimate such as this is useful, since it gives an upper bound for the error of the
approximation in terms of quantities that are known at the outset. In particular, it can be
used to determine how large we should choose n in order to have an approximation that will
be correct to within a specified error e &gt; 0.
The above discussion was valid for the case that f is increasing on [a, b]. If f is
decreasing, then the inequalities in (2) should be reversed. We can summarize both cases in
the following statement.

The Trapezoidal Rule
The method of numerical integration called the ‘‘Trapezoidal Rule’’ is based on approximating the continuous function f : ½a; b# ! R by a piecewise linear continuous function.

CHAPTER 7 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Let n 2 N and, as before, let hn :¼ ðb # aÞ=n and consider the partition P n . We approximate f by the piecewise linear function gn that passes through the points
Rb
ða þ khn ; f ða þ khn ÞÞ, where k ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; n.RIt seems reasonable that the integral a f
b
will be ‘‘approximately equal to’’ the integral a gn when n is sufficiently large (provided
that f is reasonably smooth).
Since the area of a trapezoid with horizontal base h and vertical sides l 1 and l 2 is known
to be 12 hðl 1 þ l 2 Þ, we have
Z aþðkþ1Þhn
1
gn ¼ hn # ½ f ða þ khn Þ þ f ða þ ðk þ 1Þhn Þ#;
2
aþkhn
for k ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; n # 1. Summing these terms and noting that each partition point in P n
except a and b belongs to two adjacent subintervals, we obtain
#
#
Z b
1
1
gn ¼ hn f ðaÞ þ f ða þ hn Þ þ # # # þ f ða þ ðk # 1Þhn Þ þ f ðbÞ :
2
2
a
But the term on the right is precisely T n ð f Þ, found in (1) as the mean of Ln ð f Þ and Rn ð f Þ.
We call T n ð f Þ the nth Trapezoidal Approximation of f.
In Theorem 7.5.1 we obtained an error estimate in the case where f is monotone; we
now state one without this restriction on f, but in terms of the second derivative f 00 of f .
7.5.3 Theorem Let f, f 0 and f 00 be continuous on [a, b] and let T n ð f Þ be the nth
Trapezoidal Approximation (1). Then there exists c 2 ½a; b# such that
Z b
ðb # aÞh2n 00
ð4Þ
T nð f Þ #
# f ðcÞ:
f ¼
12
a
A proof of this result will be given in Appendix D; it depends on a number of results we
have obtained in Chapters 5 and 6.
The equality (4) is interesting
in that it can give both an upper bound and a lower bound
Rb
for the difference T n ð f Þ # a f . For example, if f 00 ðxÞ # A &gt; 0 for all x 2 ½a; b#, then (4)
1
implies that this difference always exceeds 12
Aðb # aÞh2n . If we only have f 00 ðxÞ # 0 for
x 2 ½a; b#, which is the case when f is convex (¼ concave upward), then the Trapezoidal
Approximation is always too large. The reader should draw a figure to visualize this.
However, it is usually the upper bound that is of greater interest.
7.5.4 Corollary Let f, f 0 , and f 00 be continuous, and let j f 00 ðxÞj # B2 for all x 2 ½a; b#.

When an upper bound B2 can be found, (5) can be used to determine how large n must
be chosen in order to be certain of a desired accuracy.

2

Thus, the accuracy in this case is considerably better than predicted in Example
&amp;
7.5.2.
The Midpoint Rule
One obvious method of approximating the integral of f is to take the Riemann sums
evaluated at the midpoints of the subintervals. Thus, if P n is the equally spaced partition
given before, the Midpoint Approximation of f is given by

Another method might be to use piecewise linear functions that are tangent to the
graph of f at the midpoints of these subintervals. At first glance, it seems as if we would
need# to know# the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at each of the midpoints
a þ k # 12 hn ðk ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; nÞ. However, it is an exercise in geometry

#
#
# #
the area of the rectangle whose height is f a þ k # 12 hn . (See Figure 7.5.1.) Thus, this
area is given by (6), and the ‘‘Tangent Trapezoid Rule’’ turns out to be the same as the
‘‘Midpoint Rule.’’ We now state a theorem showing that the Midpoint Rule gives better
accuracy than the Trapezoidal Rule by a factor of 2.
7.5.6 Theorem Let f, f 0 , and f 00 be continuous on [a, b] and let M n ð f Þ be the nth

CHAPTER 7 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

As in the case with Theorem 7.5.3,Rformula (7) can be used to give both an upper bound
b
and a lower bound for the difference a f # M n ð f Þ, although it is an upper bound that is
usually of greater interest. In contrast with the Trapezoidal Rule, if the function is convex,
then the Midpoint Approximation is always too small.
The next result is parallel to Corollary 7.5.4.

Simpson’s Rule
The final approximation procedure that we will consider usually gives a better approximation than either the Trapezoidal or the Midpoint Rule and requires essentially no extra
calculation. However, the convexity (or the concavity) of f does not give any information
about the error for this method.
Whereas the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules were based on the approximation of f by
piecewise linear functions, Simpson’s Rule approximates the graph of f by parabolic arcs.
To help motivate the formula, the reader may show that if three points
ð#h; y0 Þ; ð0; y1 Þ; and ðh; y2 Þ
are given, then the quadratic function qðxÞ :¼ Ax2 þ Bx þ C that passes through these
points has the property that
Z h
1
q ¼ hðy0 þ 4y1 þ y2 Þ:
3
#h
Now let f be a continuous function on [a, b] and let n 2 N be even, and let
hn :¼ ðb # aÞ=n. On each ‘‘double subinterval’’
½a; a þ 2hn #; ½a þ 2hn ; a þ 4hn #; . . . ; ½b # 2hn ; b#;
we approximate f by n=2 quadratic functions that agree with f at the points
y0 :¼ f ðaÞ;

y1 :¼ f ða þ hn Þ;

y2 :¼ f ða þ 2hn Þ; . . . ;

yn :¼ f ðbÞ:

These considerations lead to the nth Simpson Approximation, defined by

Note that the coefficients of the values of f at the n þ 1 partition points follow the pattern
1; 4; 2; 4; 2; . . . ; 4; 2; 4; 1.
We now state a theorem that gives an estimate about the accuracy of the Simpson
Approximation; it involves the fourth derivative of f.
7.5.8 Theorem Let f, f 0 , f 00 , f ð3Þ , and f ð4Þ be continuous on [a, b] and let n 2 N be even. If

CHAPTER 8

SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

In previous chapters we have often made use of sequences of real numbers. In this chapter
we shall consider sequences whose terms are functions rather than real numbers.
Sequences of functions arise naturally in real analysis and are especially useful in obtaining
approximations to a given function and defining new functions from known ones.
In Section 8.1 we will introduce two different notions of convergence for a sequence of
functions: pointwise convergence and uniform convergence. The latter type of convergence
is very important, and will be the main focus of our attention. The reason for this focus is
the fact that, as is shown in Section 8.2, uniform convergence ‘‘preserves’’ certain
properties in the sense that if each term of a uniformly convergent sequence of functions
possesses these properties, then the limit function also possesses the properties.
In Section 8.3 we will apply the concept of uniform convergence to define and derive
the basic properties of the exponential and logarithmic functions. Section 8.4 is devoted to
a similar treatment of the trigonometric functions.

Section 8.1 Pointwise and Uniform Convergence
Let A # R be given and suppose that for each n 2 N there is a function f n : A ! R; we
shall say that ( fn) is a sequence of functions on A to R. Clearly, for each x 2 A, such a
sequence gives rise to a sequence of real numbers, namely the sequence
ð1Þ

ð f n ðxÞÞ;

obtained by evaluating each of the functions at the point x. For certain values of x 2 A the
sequence (1) may converge, and for other values of x 2 A this sequence may diverge. For
each x 2 A for which the sequence (1) converges, there is a uniquely determined real
number limð f n ðxÞÞ. In general, the value of this limit, when it exists, will depend on the
choice of the point x 2 A. Thus, there arises in this way a function whose domain consists
of all numbers x 2 A for which the sequence (1) converges.
8.1.1 Definition Let ð f n Þ be a sequence of functions on A # R to R, let A0 # A, and let
f : A0 ! R. We say that the sequence ð f n Þ converges on A0 to f if, for each x 2 A0 , the
sequence ð f n ðxÞÞ converges to f (x) in R. In this case we call f the limit on A0 of the
sequence ð f n Þ. When such a function f exists, we say that the sequence ð f n Þ is convergent
on A0, or that ð f n Þ converges pointwise on A0.
It follows from Theorem 3.1.4 that, except for a possible modification of the domain
A0, the limit function is uniquely determined. Ordinarily we choose A0 to be the largest set
possible; that is, we take A0 to be the set of all x 2 A for which the sequence (1) is
convergent in R.

CHAPTER 8 SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

In order to symbolize that the sequence ð f n Þ converges on A0 to f, we sometimes
write
f ¼ limð f n Þ

on A0 ;

or f n ! f

on

A0 :

Sometimes, when fn and f are given by formulas, we write
f ðxÞ ¼ lim f n ðxÞ

for

x 2 A0 ;

or f n ðxÞ ! f ðxÞ

for

x 2 A0 :

8.1.2 Examples (a) lim(x=n) ¼ 0 for x 2 R.
For n 2 N, let f n ðxÞ :¼ x=n and let f ðxÞ :¼ 0 for x 2 R. By Example 3.1.6(a), we
have lim(1=n) ¼ 0. Hence it follows from Theorem 3.2.3 that
limð f n ðxÞÞ ¼ limðx=nÞ ¼ x limð1=nÞ ¼ x # 0 ¼ 0
for all x 2 R. (See Figure 8.1.1.)

Figure 8.1.1

fn(x) ¼ x=n

Figure 8.1.2

gn(x) ¼ xn

(b) lim(xn).
Let gn ðxÞ :¼ xn for x 2 R; n 2 N. (See Figure 8.1.2.) Clearly, if x ¼ 1, then the
sequence (gn(1)) ¼ (1) converges to 1. It follows from Example 3.1.11(b) that lim(xn) ¼ 0
for 0 # x &lt; 1 and it is readily seen that this is also true for #1 &lt; x &lt; 0. If x ¼ #1, then
gn ð#1Þ ¼ ð#1Þn , and it was seen in Example 3.2.8(b) that the sequence is divergent.
Similarly, if jxj &gt; 1, then the sequence (xn) is not bounded, and so it is not convergent in R.
We conclude that if
#
0
for #1 &lt; x &lt; 1;
gðxÞ :¼
1
for x ¼ 1;
then the sequence (gn) converges to g on the set ð#1; 1#.
(c) limððx2 þ nxÞ=nÞ ¼ x for x 2 R.
Let hn ðxÞ: ¼ ðx2 þ nxÞ=n for x 2 R, n 2 N, and let hðxÞ :¼ x for x 2 R. (See
Figure 8.1.3.) Since we have hn ðxÞ ¼ ðx2 =nÞ þ x, it follows from Example 3.1.6(a)
and Theorem 3.2.3 that hn ðxÞ ! x ¼ hðxÞ for all x 2 R.

(d) lim((1=n) sin(nx þ n)) ¼ 0 for x 2 R.
Let F n ðxÞ :¼ ð1=nÞ sinðnx þ nÞ for x 2 R; n 2 N; and let FðxÞ :¼ 0 for x 2 R. (See

should note that, given any e &gt; 0, if n is sufficiently large, then jF n ðxÞ # FðxÞj &lt; e for all
&amp;
values of x simultaneously!
Partly to reinforce Definition 8.1.1 and partly to prepare the way for the important
notion of uniform convergence, we reformulate Definition 8.1.1 as follows.
8.1.3 Lemma A sequence ( fn) of functions on A # R to R converges to a function
f : A0 ! R on A0 if and only if for each e &gt; 0 and each x 2 A0 there is a natural number
Kðe; xÞ such that if n # Kðe; xÞ, then
ð3Þ

j f n ðxÞ # f ðxÞj &lt; e:

We leave it to the reader to show that this is equivalent to Definition 8.1.1. We wish to
emphasize that the value of Kðe; xÞ will depend, in general, on both e &gt; 0 and x 2 A0 . The
reader should confirm the fact that in Examples 8.1.2(a–c), the value of Kðe; xÞ required to
obtain an inequality such as (3) does depend on both e &gt; 0 and x 2 A0 . The intuitive reason
for this is that the convergence of the sequence is ‘‘significantly faster’’ at some points than
it is at others. However, in Example 8.1.2(d), as we have seen in inequality (2), if we choose
n sufficiently large, we can make jF n ðxÞ # FðxÞj &lt; e for all values of x 2 R. It is precisely
this rather subtle difference that distinguishes between the notion of the ‘‘pointwise
convergence’’ of a sequence of functions (as defined in Definition 8.1.1) and the notion of
‘‘uniform convergence.’’
Uniform Convergence
8.1.4 Definition A sequence ( fn) of functions on A # R to R converges uniformly on
A0 # A to a function f : A0 ! R if for each e &gt; 0 there is a natural number KðeÞ
(depending on e but not on x 2 A0 ) such that if n # KðeÞ, then

CHAPTER 8 SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

In this case we say that the sequence ( fn) is uniformly convergent on A0. Sometimes we
write
fn F

f

on A0 ;

f n ðxÞ F

or

f ðxÞ

for

x 2 A0 :

It is an immediate consequence of the definitions that if the sequence ( fn) is uniformly
convergent on A0 to f, then this sequence also converges pointwise on A0 to f in the sense of
Definition 8.1.1. That the converse is not always true is seen by a careful examination of
Examples 8.1.2(a–c); other examples will be given below.
It is sometimes useful to have the following necessary and sufficient condition for a
sequence ( fn) to fail to converge uniformly on A0 to f.
8.1.5 Lemma A sequence ( fn) of functions on A # R to R does not converge uniformly
#on A#0 # A to a function f : A0 ! R if and only if for some e0 &gt; 0 there is a subsequence
f nk of ð f n Þ and a sequence ðxk Þ in A0 such that
#
#
# f n ðxk Þ # f ðxk Þ# # e0
k

ð5Þ

for all

k 2 N:

The proof of this result requires only that the reader negate Definition 8.1.4; we
leave this to the reader as an important exercise. We now show how this result can be
used.
8.1.6 Examples (a)
8.1.2(a). If we let nk :¼ k and xk :¼ k, then
# Consider Example
#
f nk ðxk Þ ¼ 1 so that # f nk ðxk Þ # f ðxk Þ# ¼ j1 # 0j ¼ 1. Therefore the sequence ( fn) does not
converge uniformly on R to f.
# #1=k
, then
(b) Consider Example 8.1.2(b). If nk :¼ k and xk :¼ 12
#
# #1
# 1
#gn ðxk Þ # gðxk Þ# ¼ # # 0# ¼ :
2
2
k
Therefore the sequence (gn) does not converge uniformly on ð#1; 1# to g.
(c) Consider Example 8.1.2(c). If nk :¼ k and xk :¼ #k, then hnk ðxk Þ ¼ 0 and hðxk Þ ¼
#k so that jhnk ðxk Þ # hðxk Þj ¼ k. Therefore the sequence (hn) does not converge uni&amp;
formly on R to h.
The Uniform Norm
In discussing uniform convergence, it is often convenient to use the notion of the uniform
norm on a set of bounded functions.
8.1.7 Definition If A # R and w : A ! R is a function, we say that w is bounded on
A if the set w(A) is a bounded subset of R. If w is bounded we define the uniform norm of
w on A by
ð6Þ

jj wjjA :¼ supfjwðxÞj : x 2 Ag:
Note that it follows that if e &gt; 0, then

ð7Þ

jj wjjA # e

jwðxÞj # e

for all x 2 A:

8.1 POINTWISE AND UNIFORM CONVERGENCE

245

Proof. ()) If ( fn) converges uniformly on A to f, then by Definition 8.1.4, given any e &gt; 0
there exists K(e) such that if n # KðeÞ and x 2 A then
j f n ðxÞ # f ðxÞj # e:
From the definition of supremum, it follows that jj f n # f jjA # e whenever n # KðeÞ. Since
e &gt; 0 is arbitrary this implies that jj f n # f jjA ! 0.
(() If jj f n # f jjA ! 0, then given e &gt; 0 there is a natural number H(e) such that if
n # HðeÞ then jj f n # f jjA # e. It follows from (7) that j f n ðxÞ # f ðxÞj # e for all n # HðeÞ
and x 2 A. Therefore ( fn) converges uniformly on A to f.
Q.E.D.
We now illustrate the use of Lemma 8.1.8 as a tool in examining a sequence of
bounded functions for uniform convergence.
8.1.9 Examples (a) We cannot apply Lemma 8.1.8 to the sequence in Example 8.1.2(a)
since the function f n ðxÞ # f ðxÞ ¼ x=n is not bounded on R.
For the sake of illustration, let A :¼ ½0; 1#. Although the sequence (x=n) did not
converge uniformly on R to the zero function, we shall show that the convergence is
uniform on A. To see this, we observe that
1
jj f n # f jjA ¼ supfjx=n # 0j : 0 # x # 1g ¼
n
so that jj f n # f jjA ! 0. Therefore ( fn) is uniformly convergent on A to f.
(b) Let gn ðxÞ :¼ xn for x 2 A :¼ ½0; 1# and n 2 N, and let gðxÞ :¼ 0 for 0 # x &lt; 1 and
gð1Þ :¼ 1. The functions gn ðxÞ # gðxÞ are bounded on A and
#n
#
for 0 # x &lt; 1
x
¼1
jj gn # gjjA ¼ sup
0
for x ¼ 1
for any n 2 N. Since jj gn # gjjA does not converge to 0, we infer that the sequence (gn)
does not converge uniformly on A to g.
(c) We cannot apply Lemma 8.1.8 to the sequence in Example 8.1.2(c) since the function
hn ðxÞ # hðxÞ ¼ x2 =n is not bounded on R.
Instead, let A :¼ ½0; 8# and consider
#
#
jj hn # hjjA ¼ sup x2 =n : 0 # x # 8 ¼ 64=n:
Therefore, the sequence (hn) converges uniformly on A to h.
(d) If we refer to Example 8.1.2(d), we see from (2) that jj F n # F jjR # 1=n. Hence (Fn)
converges uniformly on R to F.
(e) Let GðxÞ :¼ xn ð1 # xÞ for x 2 A :¼ ½0; 1#. Then the sequence (Gn(x)) converges to
GðxÞ :¼ 0 for each x 2 A. To calculate the uniform norm of Gn # G ¼ Gn on A, we find the
derivative and solve
G0n ðxÞ ¼ xn#1 ðn # ðn þ 1ÞxÞ ¼ 0
to obtain the point xn :¼ n=ðn þ 1Þ. This is an interior point of [0, 1], and it is easily
verified by using the First Derivative Test 6.2.8 that Gn attains a maximum on [0, 1] at xn.
Therefore, we obtain
1
;
jj Gn jjA ¼ Gn ðxn Þ ¼ ð1 þ 1=nÞ#n #
nþ1
which converges to ð1=eÞ # 0 ¼ 0. Thus we see that convergence is uniform on A.

CHAPTER 8 SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

By making use of the uniform norm, we can obtain a necessary and sufficient condition
for uniform convergence that is often useful.
8.1.10 Cauchy Criterion for Uniform Convergence Let ( fn) be a sequence of bounded
functions on A # R. Then this sequence converges uniformly on A to a bounded function f
if and only if for each e &gt; 0 there is a number H(e) in N such that for all m; n # HðeÞ, then
&amp;
jj f m # f n jjA # e.
# #
Proof. ()) #If f#n F f on A, then given e &gt; 0 there exists a natural
number K 12 e such
#
#
that if n # K 12 e then jj f n # f jjA # 12 e. Hence, if both m; n # K 12 e , then we conclude
that
j f m ðxÞ # f n ðxÞj # j f m ðxÞ # f ðxÞj þ j f n ðxÞ # f ðxÞj # 12 e þ 12 e ¼ e
# #
for all x 2 A. Therefore jj f m # f n jjA # e for m; n # K 12 e ¼: HðeÞ.
(() Conversely, suppose that for e &gt; 0 there is H(e) such that if m; n # HðeÞ, then
jj f m # f n jjA # e. Therefore, for each x 2 A we have
ð8Þ

j f m ðxÞ # f n ðxÞj # jj f m # f n jjA # e

for

m; n # HðeÞ:

It follows that (fn(x)) is a Cauchy sequence in R; therefore, by Theorem 3.5.5, it is a
convergent sequence. We define f : A ! R by
f ðxÞ :¼ limð f n ðxÞÞ

for

x 2 A:

If we let n ! 1 in (8), it follows from Theorem 3.2.6 that for each x 2 A we have
j f m ðxÞ # f ðxÞj # e

for

m # HðeÞ:

Therefore the sequence ( fn) converges uniformly on A to f.

Section 8.2 Interchange of Limits
It is often useful to know whether the limit of a sequence of functions is a continuous
function, a differentiable function, or a Riemann integrable function. Unfortunately, it is
not always the case that the limit of a sequence of functions possesses these useful
properties.
8.2.1 Examples (a) Let gn ðxÞ :¼ xn for x 2 ½0; 1# and n 2 N. Then, as we have noted in
Example 8.1.2(b), the sequence (gn) converges pointwise to the function
#
0
for 0 # x &lt; 1;
gðxÞ :¼
1
for x ¼ 1:
Although all of the functions gn are continuous at x ¼ 1, the limit function g is not
continuous at x ¼ 1. Recall that it was shown in Example 8.1.6(b) that this sequence does
not converge uniformly to g on [0, 1].
(b) Each of the functions gn ðxÞ ¼ xn in part (a) has a continuous derivative on [0,1].
However, the limit function g does not have a derivative at x ¼ 1, since it is not continuous
at that point.

CHAPTER 8 SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

(See Figure 8.2.1.) It is clear that each of the functions fn is continuous on [0, 1]; hence it is
Riemann integrable. Either by means of a direct calculation, or by referring to the
significance of the integral as an area, we obtain

f n ðxÞdx ¼ 1 for n # 2:

The reader may show that f n ðxÞ ! 0 for all x 2 ½0; 1#; hence

Although the extent of the discontinuity of the limit function in Example 8.2.1 (a) is
not very great, it is evident that more complicated examples can be constructed that will
produce more extensive discontinuity. In any case, we must abandon the hope that the limit
of a convergent sequence of continuous [respectively, differentiable, integrable] functions
will be continuous [respectively, differentiable, integrable].
It will now be seen that the additional hypothesis of uniform convergence is sufficient
to guarantee that the limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous. Similar
results will also be established for sequences of differentiable and integrable functions.
Interchange of Limit and Continuity

Remark Although the uniform convergence of the sequence of continuous functions
is sufficient to guarantee the continuity of the limit function, it is not necessary.
(See Exercise 2.)
Interchange of Limit and Derivative
We mentioned in Section 6.1 that Weierstrass showed that the function defined by the series
1
X
# #
f ðxÞ :¼
2#k cos 3k x
k¼0

is continuous at every point but does not have a derivative at any point in R. By considering
the partial sums of this series, we obtain a sequence of functions ( fn) that possess a
derivative at every point and are uniformly convergent to f. Thus, even though the sequence
of differentiable functions ( fn) is uniformly convergent, it does not follow that the limit
function is differentiable. (See Exercises 9 and 10.)# #
We now show that if the sequence of derivatives f 0n is uniformly convergent, then all
is well. If one adds the hypothesis that the derivatives are continuous, then it is possible to
give a short proof, based on the integral. (See Exercise 11.) However, if the derivatives are
not assumed to be continuous, a somewhat more delicate argument is required.
8.2.3 Theorem Let J # R be a bounded interval and let ( fn) be a sequence of functions
on J to R.# Suppose
that there exists x0 2 J such that ð f n ðx0 ÞÞ converges, and that the
#
sequence f 0n of derivatives exists on J and converges uniformly on J to a function g.
Then the sequence ( fn) converges uniformly on J to a function f that has a derivative at
every point of J and f 0 ¼ g.

Proof. Let a &lt; b be the endpoints of J and let x 2 J be arbitrary. If m; n 2 N, we apply the
Mean Value Theorem 6.2.4 to the difference fm # fn on the interval with endpoints x0, x.
We conclude that there exists a point y (depending on m, n) such that

From Theorem 8.1.10, it follows from (1) and the hypotheses that ð f n ðx0 ÞÞ is convergent
and that ð f n0 Þ is uniformly convergent on J, that ( fn) is uniformly convergent on J. We
denote the limit of the sequence ( fn) by f. Since the fn are all continuous and the
convergence is uniform, it follows from Theorem 8.2.2 that f is continuous on J.
To establish the existence of the derivative of f at a point c 2 J, we apply the Mean
Value Theorem 6.2.4 to f m # f n on an interval with end points c, x. We conclude that there
exists a point z (depending on m, n) such that
f f m ðxÞ # f n ðxÞg # f f m ðcÞ # f n ðcÞg ¼ ðx # cÞf f m0 ðzÞ # f n0 ðzÞg:

We will now show that uniform convergence of the sequence is sufficient to guarantee that
this equality holds.

Q.E.D.

The hypothesis of uniform convergence is a very stringent one and restricts the utility
of this result. In Section 10.4 we will obtain some far-reaching generalizations of Theorem
8.2.4. For the present, we will state a result that does not require the uniformity of the
convergence, but does require that the limit function be Riemann integrable. The proof is
omitted.
8.2.5 Bounded Convergence Theorem Let ( fn) be a sequence in R½a; b# that converges

CHAPTER 8 SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

Dini’s Theorem
We will end this section with a famous theorem due to Ulisse Dini (1845–1918) that gives a
partial converse to Theorem 8.2.2 when the sequence is monotone. We will present a proof
using nonconstant gauges (see Section 5.5).
8.2.6 Dini’s Theorem Suppose that (fn) is a monotone sequence of continuous functions
on I :¼ [a, b] that converges on I to a continuous function f. Then the convergence of the
sequence is uniform.
Proof. We suppose that the sequence ( fn) is decreasing and let gm :¼ fm # f. Then (gm) is a
decreasing sequence of continuous functions converging on I to the 0-function. We will
show that the convergence is uniform on I.
Given e &gt; 0, t 2 I, there exists me;t 2 N such that 0 # gme;t ðtÞ &lt; e=2. Since gme;t is
continuous at t, there exists de ðtÞ &gt; 0 such that 0 # gme;t ðxÞ &lt; e for all x 2 I satisfying
jx # 1j # de ðtÞ. Thus, de is a gauge on I, and if P_ ¼ fðI i ; ti Þgni¼1 is a de -fine partition, we set
M e :¼ maxfme;t1 ; . . . ; me;tn g. If m # Me and x 2 I, then (by Lemma 5.5.3) there exists an
index i with jx # ti j # de ðti Þ and hence
0 # gm ðxÞ # gm;ti ðxÞ &lt; e:
Therefore, the sequence (gm) converges uniformly to the 0-function.

Q.E.D.

It will be seen in the exercises that we cannot drop any one of the three hypotheses:
(i) the functions fn are continuous, (ii) the limit function f is continuous, (iii) I is a closed
bounded interval.

8. Let fn(x) :¼ nx=(1 þ nx2) for x 2 A :¼ [0, 1). Show that each fn is bounded on A,

Section 8.3 The Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
We will now introduce the exponential and logarithmic functions and will derive some of
their most important properties. In earlier sections of this book we assumed some
familiarity with these functions for the purpose of discussing examples. However, it is
necessary at some point to place these important functions on a firm foundation in order to
establish their existence and determine their basic properties. We will do that here. There
are several alternative approaches one can take to accomplish this goal. We will proceed by
first proving the existence of a function that has itself as derivative. From this basic result,
we obtain the main properties of the exponential function. The logarithm function is then
introduced as the inverse of the exponential function, and this inverse relation is used to
derive the properties of the logarithm function.
The Exponential Function
We begin by establishing the key existence result for the exponential function.
8.3.1 Theorem There exists a function E : R ! R such that:
(i)
(ii)

E0 ðxÞ ¼ EðxÞ f or all x 2 R.
Eð0Þ ¼ 1.

En ðtÞdt;

for all n 2 N; x 2 R. Clearly E1 is continuous on R and hence is integrable over any
bounded interval. If En has been defined and is continuous on R, then it is integrable over
any bounded interval, so that Enþ1 is well-defined by the above formula. Moreover, it
follows from the Fundamental Theorem (Second Form) 7.3.5 that Enþ1 is differentiable at
any point x 2 R and that
ð3Þ

E0nþ1 ðxÞ ¼ En ðxÞ

for

n 2 N:

An Induction argument (which we leave to the reader) shows that

En ðxÞ ¼ 1 þ

Since lim(An=n!) ¼ 0, it follows that the sequence (En) converges uniformly on the interval
[#A, A] where A &gt; 0 is arbitrary. In particular this means that (En(x)) converges for each
x 2 R. We define E : R ! R by
EðxÞ :¼ lim En ðxÞ

for

x 2 R:

Since each x 2 R is contained inside some interval [#A, A], it follows from Theorem 8.2.2
that E is continuous at x. Moreover, it is clear from (1) and (2) that En ð0Þ ¼ 1 for all n 2 N.
Therefore Eð0Þ ¼ 1, which proves (ii).
On any interval [#A, A] we have the uniform convergence of the sequence (En). In
view of (3), we also have the uniform convergence of the sequence (E0n ) of derivatives. It
therefore follows from Theorem 8.2.3 that the limit function E is differentiable on [#A, A]
and that
E0 ðxÞ ¼ limðE0n ðxÞÞ ¼ limðEn#1 ðxÞÞ ¼ EðxÞ
for all x 2 [#A, A]. Since A &gt; 0 is arbitrary, statement (i) is established.

Induction.
Q.E.D.
8.3.3 Corollary If x &gt; 0, then 1 þ x &lt; E(x).
Proof. It is clear from (4) that if x &gt; 0, then the sequence (En (x)) is strictly increasing.
Hence E1(x) &lt; E(x) for all x &gt; 0.
Q.E.D.
It is next shown that the function E, whose existence was established in Theorem 8.3.1,
is unique.
8.3.4 Theorem The function E : R ! R that satisfies (i) and (ii) of Theorem 8.3.1 is
unique.
Proof. Let E1 and E2 be two functions on R to R that satisfy properties (i) and (ii) of
Theorem 8.3.1 and let F :¼ E1 # E2 . Then
F 0 ðxÞ ¼ E01 ðxÞ # E02 ðxÞ ¼ E1 ðxÞ # E2 ðxÞ ¼ FðxÞ
for all x 2 R and
Fð0Þ ¼ E1 ð0Þ # E2 ð0Þ ¼ 1 # 1 ¼ 0:
It is clear (by Induction) that F has derivatives of all orders and indeed that F ðnÞ ðxÞ ¼ FðxÞ
for n 2 N; x 2 R.
Let x 2 R be arbitrary, and let Ix be the closed interval with endpoints 0, x. Since F is
continuous on Ix, there exists K &gt; 0 such that jFðtÞj # K for all t 2 I x . If we apply Taylor’s
Theorem 6.4.1 to F on the interval Ix and use the fact that F (k)(0) ¼ F(0) ¼ 0 for all k 2 N,
it follows that for each n 2 N there is a point cn 2 Ix such that
FðxÞ ¼ Fð0Þ þ

But since lim(jxj=n!) ¼ 0, we conclude that F(x) ¼ 0. Since x 2 R is arbitrary, we infer that
E1 ðxÞ # E2 ðxÞ ¼ FðxÞ ¼ 0 for all x 2 R.
Q.E.D.
The standard terminology and notation for the function E (which we now know exists
and is unique) is given in the following definition.
8.3.5 Definition The unique function E : R ! R, such that E0 ðxÞ ¼ EðxÞ for all x 2 R
and E(0) ¼ 1, is called the exponential function. The number e :¼ E(1) is called Euler’s
number. We will frequently write
expðxÞ :¼ EðxÞ

or

ex :¼ EðxÞ

for

x 2 R:

The number e can be obtained as a limit, and thereby approximated, in several different
ways. [See Exercises 1 and 10, and Example 3.3.6.]
The use of the notation ex for E(x) is justified by property (v) in the next theorem,
where it is noted that if r is a rational number, then E(r) and er coincide. (Rational

exponents were discussed in Section 5.6.) Thus, the function E can be viewed as extending
the idea of exponentiation from rational numbers to arbitrary real numbers. For a definition
of ax for a &gt; 0 and arbitrary x 2 R, see Definition 8.3.10.
8.3.6 Theorem The exponential function satisfies the following properties:
(iii) EðxÞ 6¼ 0 f or all x 2 R;
(iv) Eðx þ yÞ ¼ EðxÞEðyÞ f or all x; y 2 R;
(v) EðrÞ ¼ er f or all r 2 Q :
Proof. (iii) Let a 2 R be such that E(a) ¼ 0, and let Ja be the closed interval with
endpoints 0, a. Let K # jEðtÞj for all t 2 J a . Taylor’s Theorem 6.4.1 implies that for each
n 2 N there exists a point cn 2 J a such that

Thus we have 0 &lt; 1 # ðK=n!Þjajn for n 2 N. But since limðjajn =n!Þ ¼ 0, this is a
contradiction.
(iv) Let y be fixed; by (iii) we have EðyÞ 6¼ 0. Let G : R ! R be defined by
GðxÞ :¼

Eðx þ yÞ
EðyÞ

for

x 2 R:

Evidently we have G0 ðxÞ ¼ E0 ðx þ yÞ=EðyÞ ¼ Eðx þ yÞ=EðyÞ ¼ GðxÞ for all x 2 R, and
Gð0Þ ¼ Eð0 þ yÞ=EðyÞ ¼ 1. It follows from the uniqueness of E, proved in Theorem 8.3.4,
that GðxÞ ¼ EðxÞ for all x 2 R. Hence Eðx þ yÞ ¼ EðxÞEðyÞ for all x 2 R. Since y 2 R
is arbitrary, we obtain (iv).
(v) It follows from (iv) and Induction that if n 2 N; x 2 R, then
EðnxÞ ¼ EðxÞn :
If we let x ¼ 1=n, this relation implies that
e ¼ Eð1Þ ¼ E n #

whence it follows that Eð1=nÞ ¼ e1=n . Also we have Eð#mÞ ¼ 1=EðmÞ ¼ 1=em ¼ e#m for

Eðm=nÞ ¼ ðEð1=nÞÞm ¼ ðe1=n Þm ¼ em=n :
This establishes (v).

Q.E.D.

8.3.7 Theorem The exponential function E is strictly increasing on R and has range
equal to fy 2 R : y &gt; 0g. Further, we have
(vi) lim EðxÞ ¼ 0 and
x!#1

lim EðxÞ ¼ 1:

x!1

Proof. We know that Eð0Þ ¼ 1 &gt; 0 and EðxÞ 6¼ 0 for all x 2 R. Since E is continuous on
R, it follows from Bolzano’s Intermediate Value Theorem 5.3.7 that EðxÞ &gt; 0 for all
x 2 R. Therefore E0 ðxÞ ¼ EðxÞ &gt; 0 for x 2 R, so that E is strictly increasing on R.

It follows from Corollary 8.3.3 that 2 &lt; e and that lim EðxÞ ¼ 1. Also, if z &gt; 0, then
x!1

since 0 &lt; Eð#zÞ ¼ 1=EðzÞ it follows that lim EðxÞ ¼ 0. Therefore, by the Intermediate

Q.E.D.

The Logarithm Function
We have seen that the exponential function E is a strictly increasing differentiable function
with domain R and range fy 2 R : y &gt; 0g. (See Figure 8.3.1.) It follows that R has an
inverse function.

Graph of L

8.3.8 Definition The function inverse to E : R ! R is called the logarithm (or the
natural logarithm). (See Figure 8.3.2.) It will be denoted by L , or by ln.
Since E and L are inverse functions, we have
ðL # EÞðxÞ ¼ x

for all x 2 R

and
ðE # LÞðyÞ ¼ y

for all y 2 R; y &gt; 0:

These formulas may also be written in the form
ln ex ¼ x;

eln y ¼ y:

8.3.9 Theorem The logarithm is a strictly increasing function L with domain
fx 2 R : x &gt; 0g and range R. The derivative of L is given by
(vii) L0 ðxÞ ¼ 1=x f or x &gt; 0:
The logarithm satisfies the functional equation
(viii) LðxyÞ ¼ LðxÞ þ LðyÞ for x &gt; 0; y &gt; 0:
Moreover, we have
(ix) LðlÞ ¼ 0 and LðeÞ ¼ 1;

Proof. That L is strictly increasing with domain fx 2 R : x &gt; 0g and range R follows
from the fact that E is strictly increasing with domain R and range fy 2 R : y &gt; 0g.
(vii) Since E0 ðxÞ ¼ EðxÞ &gt; 0, it follows from Theorem 6.1.9 that L is differentiable

(viii) If x &gt; 0, y &gt; 0, let u :¼ L(x) and v :¼ L(y). Then we have x ¼ E(u) and y ¼ E(v).
It follows from property (iv) of Theorem 8.3.6 that
xy ¼ EðuÞEðvÞ ¼ Eðu þ vÞ;
so that LðxyÞ ¼ ðL # EÞðu þ vÞ ¼ u þ v ¼ LðxÞ þ LðyÞ. This establishes (viii).
The properties in (ix) follow from the relations Eð0Þ ¼ 1 and Eð1Þ ¼ e.
(x) This result follows from (viii) and Mathematical Induction for n 2 N, and is
extended to r 2 Q by arguments similar to those in the proof of 8.3.6(v).
To establish property (xi), we first note that since 2 &lt; e, then lim(en) ¼ 1 and
lim(e#n) ¼ 0. Since L(en) ¼ n and L(e#n) ¼ #n it follows from the fact that L is strictly

Power Functions
In Definition 5.6.6, we discussed the power function x 7! xr ; x &gt; 0, where r is a rational
number. By using the exponential and logarithm functions, we can extend the notion of
power functions from rational to arbitrary real powers.
8.3.10 Definition If a 2 R and x &gt; 0, the number xa is defined to be
xa :¼ ea ln x ¼ EðaLðxÞÞ:
The function x 7! xa for x &gt; 0 is called the power function with exponent a.
Note If x &gt; 0 and a ¼ m=n where m 2 Z; n 2 N, then we defined xa :¼ ðxm Þ1=n in
a
Section 5.6. Hence we have ln xa ¼ a ln x, whence xa ¼ eln x ¼ ea ln x . Hence Definition
8.3.10 is consistent with the definition given in Section 5.6.
We now state some properties of the power functions. Their proofs are immediate
consequences of the properties of the exponential and logarithm functions and will be left
to the reader.

8.3.13 Theorem Let a 2 R . Then the function x 7! xa on (0, 1) to R is continuous and
differentiable, and
Dxa ¼ axa#1
for x 2 ð0; 1Þ:
Proof. By the Chain Rule we have
Dxa ¼ Dea ln x ¼ ea ln x # Dða ln xÞ
a#1
¼ xa # a
for x 2 ð0; 1Þ:
x ¼ ax

Q.E.D.

It will be seen in an exercise that if a &gt; 0, the power function x 7! xa is strictly increasing
on (0, 1) to R, and that if a &lt; 0, the function x 7! xa is strictly decreasing. (What happens
if a ¼ 0?)
The graphs of the functions x 7! xa on (0, 1) to R are similar to those in Figure 5.6.8.
The Function loga
If a &gt; 0, a 6¼ 1, it is sometimes useful to define the function loga.
8.3.14 Definition Let a &gt; 0, a 6¼ 1. We define
loga ðxÞ :¼

ln x
ln a

for

x 2 ð0; 1Þ:

For x 2 (0, 1), the number loga(x) is called the logarithm of x to the base a. The case a ¼
e yields the logarithm (or natural logarithm) function of Definition 8.3.8. The case a ¼ 10
gives the base 10 logarithm (or common logarithm) function log10 often used in
computations. Properties of the functions loga will be given in the exercises.

Section 8.4 The Trigonometric Functions
Along with the exponential and logarithmic functions, there is another very important
collection of transcendental functions known as the ‘‘trigonometric functions.’’ These are
the sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions. In elementary courses,
they are usually introduced on a geometric basis in terms of either triangles or the unit
circle. In this section, we introduce the trigonometric functions in an analytical manner and
then establish some of their basic properties. In particular, the various properties of the
trigonometric functions that were used in examples in earlier parts of this book will be
derived rigorously in this section.
It suffices to deal with the sine and cosine since the other four trigonometric functions
are defined in terms of these two. Our approach to the sine and cosine is similar in spirit to

our approach to the exponential function in that we first establish the existence of functions
that satisfy certain differentiation properties.
8.4.1 Theorem There exist functions C : R ! R and S : R ! R such that
(i)
(ii)

C 00 ðxÞ ¼ #CðxÞ and S00 ðxÞ ¼ #SðxÞ f or all x 2 R:
Cð0Þ ¼ 1; C0 ð0Þ ¼ 0; and Sð0Þ ¼ 0; S0 ð0Þ ¼ 1:

Proof. We define the sequences (Cn) and (Sn) of continuous functions inductively as
follows:
ð1Þ

C1 ðxÞ :¼ 1;
S1 ðxÞ :¼ x;
Z x
Sn ðxÞ :¼
Cn ðtÞdt;

ð2Þ

Cnþ1 ðxÞ :¼ 1 #

ð3Þ

Sn ðtÞdt;

for all n 2 N, x 2 R.
One sees by Induction that the functions Cn and Sn are continuous on R and hence they
are integrable over any bounded interval; thus these functions are well-defined by the above
formulas. Moreover, it follows from the Fundamental Theorem 7.3.5 that Sn and Cnþ1 are
differentiable at every point and that
ð4Þ

Sn0 ðxÞ ¼ C n ðxÞ

and

0
Cnþ1
ðxÞ ¼ #Sn ðxÞ

Since limðA2n =ð2nÞ!Þ ¼ 0, the sequence (Cn) converges uniformly on the interval ½#A; A#,
where A &gt; 0 is arbitrary. In particular, this means that (C n ðxÞ) converges for each x 2 R.
We define C : R ! R by
for x 2 R:
CðxÞ :¼ lim Cn ðxÞ
It follows from Theorem 8.2.2 that C is continuous on R and, since Cn ð0Þ ¼ 1 for all n 2 N,
that Cð0Þ ¼ 1.
If jxj # A and m # n &gt; 2A, it follows from (2) that

If we use (5) and Corollary 7.3.15, we conclude that
jSm ðxÞ # Sn ðxÞj #

A2n 16
A ;
ð2nÞ! 15

whence the sequence (Sn) converges uniformly on ½#A; A#. We define S : R ! R by
SðxÞ :¼ lim Sn ðxÞ

for

x 2 R:

It follows from Theorem 8.2.2 that S is continuous on R and, since Sn ð0Þ ¼ 0 for all n 2 N,
that Sð0Þ ¼ 0.
Since Cn0 ðxÞ ¼ #Sn#1 ðxÞ for n &gt; 1, it follows from the above that the sequence
0
(Cn ) converges uniformly on ½#A; A#. Hence by Theorem 8.2.3, the limit function C is
differentiable on ½#A; A# and
C0 ðxÞ ¼ lim C 0n ðxÞ ¼ limð#Sn#1 ðxÞÞ ¼ #SðxÞ

for

x 2 ½#A; A#:

Since A &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we have
ð6Þ

C 0 ðxÞ ¼ #SðxÞ

A similar argument, based on the fact that
R and that
ð7Þ

Sn0 ðxÞ

S0 ðxÞ ¼ CðxÞ

for

x 2 R:

¼ C n ðxÞ, shows that S is differentiable on
for all x 2 R:

It follows from (6) and (7) that
C 00 ðxÞ ¼ #ðSðxÞÞ0 ¼ #CðxÞ

and

S00 ðxÞ ¼ ðCðxÞÞ0 ¼ #SðxÞ

for all x 2 R. Moreover, we have
C 0 ð0Þ ¼ #Sð0Þ ¼ 0;

S0 ð0Þ ¼ Cð0Þ ¼ 1:

Thus statements (i) and (ii) are proved.

Q.E.D.

8.4.2 Corollary If C, S are the functions in Theorem 8.4.1, then
(iii) C 0 ðxÞ ¼ #SðxÞ and S0 ðxÞ ¼ CðxÞ for x 2 R.
Moreover, these functions have derivatives of all orders.
Proof. The formulas (iii) were established in (6) and (7). The existence of the higher order
derivatives follows by Induction.
Q.E.D.
8.4.3 Corollary The functions C and S satisfy the Pythagorean Identity:
(iv) ðCðxÞÞ2 þ ðSðxÞÞ2 ¼ 1 for x 2 R.
Proof. Let f ðxÞ :¼ ðCðxÞÞ2 þ ðSðxÞÞ2 for x 2 R, so that
f 0 ðxÞ ¼ 2CðxÞð#SðxÞÞ þ 2SðxÞðCðxÞÞ ¼ 0

for

x 2 R:

Thus it follows that f (x) is a constant for all x 2 R. But since f ð0Þ ¼ 1 þ 0 ¼ 1, we
conclude that f ðxÞ ¼ 1 for all x 2 R.
Q.E.D.
We next establish the uniqueness of the functions C and S.
8.4.4 Theorem The functions C and S satisfying properties (i) and (ii) of Theorem 8.4.1
are unique.

8.4 THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS

263

Proof. Let C1 and C2 be two functions on R to R that satisfy C 00j ðxÞ ¼ #Cj ðxÞ for all
x 2 R and Cj ð0Þ ¼ 1, Cj0ð0Þ ¼ 0 for j ¼ 1; 2. If we let D :¼ C1 # C2 , then D00 ðxÞ ¼ #DðxÞ
for x 2 R and Dð0Þ ¼ 0 and DðkÞ ð0Þ ¼ 0 for all k 2 N.
Now let x 2 R be arbitrary, and let I x be the interval with endpoints 0; x. Since D ¼
C 1 # C2 and T :¼ S1 # S2 ¼ C20 # C10 are continuous on I x , there exists K &gt; 0 such that
jDðtÞj # K and jTðtÞj # K for all t 2 I x . If we apply Taylor’s Theorem 6.4.1 to D on I x and
use the fact that Dð0Þ ¼ 0; DðkÞ ð0Þ ¼ 0 for k 2 N, it follows that for each n 2 N there is a
point cn 2 I x such that
DðxÞ ¼ Dð0Þ þ

Now either DðnÞ ðcn Þ ¼

Tðcn Þ. In either case we have
K jxjn

But since lim ðjxjn =n!Þ ¼ 0, we conclude that DðxÞ ¼ 0. Since x 2 R is arbitrary, we infer
that C1 ðxÞ # C 2 ðxÞ ¼ 0 for all x 2 R.
A similar argument shows that if S1 and S2 are two functions on R ! R such that
S00j ðxÞ ¼ #Sj ðxÞ for all x 2 R and Sj ð0Þ ¼ 0, S0j ð0Þ ¼ 1 for j ¼ 1, 2, then we have S1 ðxÞ ¼
S2 ðxÞ for all x 2 R.
Q.E.D.
Now that existence and uniqueness of the functions C and S have been established, we
shall give these functions their familiar names.
8.4.5 Definition The unique functions C : R ! R and S : R ! R such that C00 ðxÞ ¼
#CðxÞ and S00 ðxÞ ¼ #SðxÞ for all x 2 R and Cð0Þ ¼ 1, C0 ð0Þ ¼ 0, and Sð0Þ ¼ 0,
S0 ð0Þ ¼ 1, are called the cosine function and the sine function, respectively. We ordinarily
write
cos x :¼ CðxÞ

and

sin x :¼ SðxÞ

for

x 2 R:

The differentiation properties in (i) of Theorem 8.4.1 do not by themselves lead to
uniquely determined functions. We have the following relationship.
8.4.6 Theorem If f : R ! R is such that
f 00 ðxÞ ¼ #f ðxÞ

for

x 2 R;

then there exist real numbers a, b such that
f ðxÞ ¼ aCðxÞ þ bSðxÞ for

x 2 R:

Proof. Let gðxÞ :¼ f ð0ÞCðxÞ þ f 0 ð0ÞSðxÞ for x 2 R. It is readily seen that g00 ðxÞ ¼
#gðxÞ and that gð0Þ ¼ f ð0Þ, and since
g0 ðxÞ ¼ #f ð0ÞSðxÞ þ f 0 ð0ÞCðxÞ;
that g0 ð0Þ ¼ f 0 ð0Þ. Therefore the function h :¼ f # g is such that h00 ðxÞ ¼ #hðxÞ for all
x 2 R and hð0Þ ¼ 0, h0 ð0Þ ¼ 0. Thus it follows from the proof of the preceding theorem
that hðxÞ ¼ 0 for all x 2 R. Therefore f ðxÞ ¼ gðxÞ for all x 2 R.

CHAPTER 8 SEQUENCES OF FUNCTIONS

We shall now derive a few of the basic properties of the cosine and sine functions.
8.4.7 Theorem The function C is even and S is odd in the sense that
(v) Cð#xÞ ¼ CðxÞ and Sð#xÞ ¼ #SðxÞ for x 2 R.
If x, y 2 R, then we have the ‘‘addition formulas’’
(vi) Cðx þ yÞ ¼ CðxÞCðyÞ # SðxÞSðyÞ;

Sðx þ yÞ ¼ SðxÞCðyÞ þ CðxÞSðyÞ.

Proof. (v) If wðxÞ :¼ Cð#xÞ for x 2 R, then a calculation shows that w00 ðxÞ ¼ #wðxÞ for
x 2 R. Moreover, wð0Þ ¼ 1 and w0 ð0Þ ¼ 0 so that w ¼ C. Hence, Cð#xÞ ¼ CðxÞ for all
x 2 R. In a similar way one shows that Sð#xÞ ¼ #SðxÞ for all x 2 R.
(vi) Let y 2 R be given and let f ðxÞ :¼ Cðx þ yÞ for x 2 R. A calculation shows that
f 00 ðxÞ ¼ #f ðxÞ for x 2 R. Hence, by Theorem 8.4.6, there exists real numbers a, b such
that
f ðxÞ ¼ Cðx þ yÞ ¼ aCðxÞ þ bSðxÞ and
f 0 ðxÞ ¼ #Sðx þ yÞ ¼ #aSðxÞ þ bCðxÞ
for x 2 R. If we let x ¼ 0, we obtain CðyÞ ¼ a and #SðyÞ ¼ b, whence the first formula in
(vi) follows. The second formula is proved similarly.
Q.E.D.

The following inequalities were used earlier (for example, in 4.2.8).
8.4.8 Theorem If x 2 R, x # 0, then we have
(vii) #x # SðxÞ # x;

(viii) 1 # 12 x2 # CðxÞ # 1;

(ix) x # 16 x3 # SðxÞ # x;

(x)

1 4
1 # 12 x2 # CðxÞ # 1 # 12 x2 þ 24
x .

Proof. Corollary 8.4.3 implies that #1 # CðtÞ # 1 for t 2 R, so that if x # 0, then
Z x
#x #
CðtÞdt # x;
0

whence we have (vii). If we integrate (vii), we obtain
Z x
# 12 x2 #
SðtÞ dt # 12 x2 ;
0

whence we have
# 12 x2 # #CðxÞ þ 1 # 12 x2 :
Thus we have 1 # 12 x2 # CðxÞ, which implies (viii).
Inequality (ix) follows by integrating (viii), and (x) follows by integrating (ix).

The number p is obtained via the following lemma.

Moreover CðxÞ &gt; 0 for x 2 ½0; gÞ. The number 2g is the smallest positive root of S.
Proof. Inequality (x) of Theorem 8.4.8 implies that C has a root between the positive root

It follows from the second formula in (vi) with x ¼ y that Sð2xÞ ¼ 2SðxÞCðxÞ. This
relation implies that Sð2gÞ ¼ 0, so that 2g is a positive root of S. The same relation implies
that if 2d &gt; 0 is the smallest positive root of S, then CðdÞ ¼ 0. Since g is the smallest
positive root of C, we have d ¼ g.

Theorem The functions C and S have period 2p in the sense that

(xi) Cðx þ 2pÞ ¼ CðxÞ and Sðx þ 2pÞ ¼ SðxÞ for x 2 R.
Moreover we have
#

x 2 R.

#
#
#
#
CðxÞ ¼ S 12 p # x ¼ S x þ 12 p for all

Proof. (xi) Since Sð2xÞ ¼ 2SðxÞCðxÞ and SðpÞ ¼ 0, then Sð2pÞ ¼ 0. Further, if x ¼ y
in (vi), we obtain Cð2xÞ ¼ ðCðxÞÞ2 # ðSðxÞÞ2 . Therefore Cð2pÞ ¼ 1. Hence (vi) with
y ¼ 2p gives
Cðx þ 2pÞ ¼ CðxÞCð2pÞ # SðxÞSð2pÞ ¼ CðxÞ;
and

Sðx þ 2pÞ ¼ SðxÞCð2pÞ þ CðxÞSð2pÞ ¼ SðxÞ:

(xii) We note that C 12 p ¼ 0, and it is an exercise to show that S 12 p ¼ 1. If we
employ these together with formulas (vi), the desired relations are obtained.

INFINITE SERIES

In Section 3.7 we gave a brief introduction to the theory of infinite series. The reader will do
well to look over that section at this time, since we will not repeat the definitions and results
given there.
Instead, in Section 9.1 we will introduce the important notion of the ‘‘absolute
convergence’’ of a series. In Section 9.2 we will present some ‘‘tests’’ for absolute
convergence that will probably be familiar to the reader from calculus. The third section
gives a discussion of series that are not absolutely convergent. In the final section we study
series of functions and will establish the basic properties of power series, which are very
important in applications.

We have already met (in Section 3.7) a number of infinite series that are convergent and
others that are divergent. For example, in Example 3.7.6(b) we saw that the harmonic
series:
1
X
1
n¼1

n

is divergent since its sequence of partial sums sn :¼ 11 þ 12 þ # # # þ 1n ðn 2 N Þ is unbounded.
On the other hand, we saw in Example 3.7.6(f) that the alternating harmonic series:
1
X
ð#1Þnþ1
n¼1

n

is convergent because of the subtraction that takes place. Since
#
#
#ð#1Þnþ1 # 1
#
#
#
#¼ ;
# n # n
P
P
these two series illustrate the fact that a series xn may be convergent, but the series jxn j
obtained by taking the absolute values of the terms may be divergent. This observation leads
us to an important definition.
P
9.1.1 Definition Let XP
:¼ (xn) be a sequence in R. We say that the series xn is absolutely
convergent if the series
jxn j is convergent in R. A series is said to be conditionally (or
nonabsolutely) convergent if it is convergent, but it is not absolutely convergent.
It is trivial that a series of positive terms is absolutely convergent if and only if it is
convergent. We have noted above that the alternating harmonic series is conditionally
convergent.

9.1.2 Theorem If a series in R is absolutely convergent, then it is convergent.
P
Proof. Since
jxn j is convergent, the Cauchy Criterion 3.7.4 implies that, given e &gt; 0
there exists M(e) 2 N such that if m &gt; n # M(e), then
jxnþ1 j þ jxnþ1 j þ # # # þ jxm j &lt; e:
However, by the Triangle Inequality, the left side of this expression dominates:
jsm # sn j ¼ jxnþ1 þ xnþ2 þ # # # þ xm j:
P
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, Cauchy’s Criterion implies that
xn converges.

Q.E.D.

Grouping of Series
P
P
Given a series xn , we can construct many other series yk by leaving the order of the
terms xn fixed, but inserting parentheses that group together finite numbers of terms. For
example, the series indicated by
#
# #

is obtained by grouping the terms in the alternating harmonic series. It is an interesting fact
that such grouping does not affect the convergence or the value of a convergent series.
P
9.1.3 Theorem If a series
xn is convergent, then any series obtained from it by
grouping the terms is also convergent and to the same value.
Proof. Suppose that we have
y1 :¼ x1 þ # # # þ xk1 ;
y2 :¼ xk1 þ1 þ # # # þ xk2 ; # # # :
P
P
If sn denotes the nth partial sum of xn and tk denotes the kth partial sum of yk , then we have
t 1 ¼ y 1 ¼ sk 1 ;

t 2 ¼ y 1 þ y 2 ¼ sk 2 ; # # # :
P
Thus, the sequence (tk) of partial
Psums of the grouped series yk is a subsequence of the
sequence (sn) of partial sums
P of xn . Since this latter series was assumed to be convergent,
so is the grouped series
yk .
Q.E.D.
It is clear that the converse to this theorem is not true. Indeed, the grouping
ð1 # 1Þ þ ð1 # 1Þ þ ð1 # 1Þ þ # # #
produces a convergent series from

1
X

ð#1Þn , which was seen to be divergent in Example

n¼0

3.7.2(b) since the terms do not approach 0.
Rearrangements of Series
Loosely speaking, a ‘‘rearrangement’’ of a series is another series that is obtained from the
given one by using all of the terms exactly once, but scrambling the order in which the
terms are taken. For example, the harmonic series has rearrangements
1 1 1 1
1
1
þ þ þ þ ### þ þ
þ ###;
2 1 4 3
2n 2n # 1
1 1 1 1 1 1

The first rearrangement is obtained from the harmonic series by interchanging the first and
second terms, the third and fourth terms, and so forth. The second rearrangement is
obtained from the harmonic series by taking one ‘‘odd term,’’ two ‘‘even terms,’’ three
‘‘odd terms,’’ and so forth. It is obvious that there are infinitely many other possible
rearrangements of the harmonic series.
P
P
9.1.4 Definition A series
yk in R is a rearrangement of a series
xn if there is a
bijection f of N onto N such that yk ¼ xf (k) for all k 2 N.
While a grouping series does not affect the convergence of a series, making rearrangeP
ments may do so. If fact, there is a remarkable observation, due to Riemann, that if sn is a
conditionally
convergent series in R, and if c 2 R is arbitrary, then there is a rearrangement
P
of
xn that converges to c.
To prove this assertion, we first note that a conditionally convergent series must contain
infinitely many positive terms and infinitely many negative terms (see Exercise 1), and that
both the series of positive terms and the series of negative terms diverge (see Exercise 2). To
construct a series converging to c, we take positive terms until the partial sum is greater than c,
then we take negative terms until the partial sum is less than c, then we take positive terms
until the partial sum is greater than c, then we take negative terms, etc.
In our manipulations with series, we generally want to be sure that rearrangements will not
affect the convergence or the value of the series. That is why the following result is important.
P
9.1.5 Rearrangement Theorem
Let
xn be an absolutely convergent series in R.
P
P
Then any rearrangement
yk of
xn converges to the same value.
P
Proof. Suppose that
xn converges to x 2 R. Thus, if e &gt; 0, let N be such that if
n, q &gt; N and sn :¼ x1 þ # # # þ xn, then
jx # sn j &lt; e

q
X

and

jxk j &lt; e :

k¼Nþ1

Let M 2 N be such that all of the terms x1, . . . , xN are contained as summands in tM :¼
y1 þ # # # þ yM. It follows that if m # M, then tm # sn is the sum of a finite number of terms
xk with index k &gt; N. Hence, for some q &gt; N, we have
jtm # sn j #

q
X

jxk j &lt; e:

k¼Nþ1

Therefore, if m # M, then we have
jtm # xj # jtm # sn j þ jsn # xj &lt; e þ e ¼ 2e:
P
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that
yk converges to x.

Q.E.D.

Exercises for Section 9.1
1. Show that if a convergent series contains only a finite number of negative terms, then it is
absolutely convergent.
2. Show that if a series is conditionally convergent, then the series obtained from its positive terms

sequence of partial sums is bounded, the Cauchy Criterion, and the Comparison and Limit
Comparison Tests.
We will now give some additional results that may be familiar from calculus. These
results are particularly useful in establishing absolute convergence.
9.2.1 Limit Comparison Test, II Suppose that X :¼ (xn) and Y :¼ (yn) are nonzero real
sequences and suppose that the following limit exists in R :

(b) If r ¼ 0 and if

Proof. This result follows immediately from Theorem 3.7.8.

Q.E.D.

The Root and Ratio Tests
The following test is due to Cauchy.
9.2.2 Root Test Let X :¼ (xn) be a sequence in R.
(a) If there exist r 2 R with r &lt; 1 and K 2 N such that
ð2Þ

jxn j1=n # r

P

f or n # K;

then the series
xn is absolutely convergent.
(b) If there exists K 2 N such that
jxn j1=n # 1

ð3Þ
then the series

P

f or n # K;
&amp;

xn is divergent.

P
Proof. (a) If (2) holds, then we have jxnj # rn for n # K. Since the geometric
series rn
P
is convergent for 0 # r &lt; 1, the Comparison Test 3.7.7 implies that jxn j is convergent.
(b) If (3) holds, then jxnj # 1 for n # K, so the terms do not approach 0 and the nth
Term Test 3.7.3 applies.
Q.E.D.
In calculus courses, one often meets the following version of the Root Test.
9.2.3 Corollary Let X :¼ (xn) be a sequence in R and suppose that the limit
ð4Þ
exists in R. Then

P

r :¼ lim jxn j1=n
xn is absolutely convergent when r &lt; 1 and is divergent when r &gt; 1.

Proof. If the limit in (4) exists and r &lt; 1, then there exist r1 with r &lt; r1 &lt; 1 and K 2 N
such that jxnj1=n &lt; r1 for n &gt; K. In this case we can apply 9.2.2(a).
If r &gt; 1, then there exists K 2 N such that jxnj1=n &gt; 1 for n # K and the nth Term Test
applies.

Note No conclusion is possible in Corollary 9.2.3 when r ¼ 1, for either convergence or

in the
P terms in jxn j are dominated by a fixed multiple of the termsP
geometric series rm with 0 &lt; r &lt; 1. The Comparison Test 3.7.7 then implies that jxn j
is convergent.
(b) If (6) holds, an Induction argument shows that jxKþmj # jxKj for m 2 N and the nth
Term Test applies.
Q.E.D.
Once again we have a familiar result from calculus.

r :¼ lim#

exists in R. Then xn is absolutely convergent when r &lt; 1 and is divergent when r &gt; 1.
Proof. If r &lt; 1 and if r &lt; r1&lt; 1, then there exists K 2 R such that jxnþ1P
=xnj &lt; r1 for n #
K. Thus Theorem 9.2.4(a) applies to give the absolute convergence of
xn .
If r &gt; 1, then there exists K 2 N such that jxnþ1=xnj&gt;1 for n # K, whence it follows
that jxkj does not converge to 0 and the nth Term Test applies.
Q.E.D.
Note No conclusion is possible in Corollary 9.2.5 when r ¼ 1, for either convergence or
divergence is possible. See Example 9.2.7(c).

The Integral Test

defined as follows: If f is in R[a, b] for every b &gt; a and if the limit lim a f ðtÞdt exists in

We will now show how the results in Theorems 9.2.1–9.2.6 can be applied to the
p-series, which were introduced in Example 3.7.6(d, e).
P
2
9.2.7 Examples (a) Consider
P the case p ¼ 2; that is, the series 1=n . We compare it
with the convergent series

# #
#n2 nðn þ 1Þ# ¼ n ¼ 1 þ n ! 1;

the Limit Comparison Test 9.2.1 implies that

(b) We demonstrate the failure of the Root Test for the p-series. Note that
# #1=n
#1#
# # ¼ 1 ¼ 1 p:
#np #
ðnp Þ1=n ðn1=n Þ
Since (see Example 3.1.11(d)) we know that n1/n ! 1, we have r ¼ 1 in Corollary 9.2.3, and
the theorem does not give any information.

the Ratio Test, in the form of Corollary 9.2.5, does not give any information.
(d) Finally, we apply the Integral Test to the p-series. Let f (t) :¼ 1=tp for t # 1 and recall
that
Z n

Z n

From these relations we see that the p-series converges if p &gt; 1 and diverges if p # 1, as we
&amp;
have seen before in 3.7.6(d, e).
Raabe’s Test
If the limits limjxnj1=n and lim(jxnþ1=xnj) that are used in Corollaries 9.2.3 and 9.2.5 equal
1, we have seen that these tests do not give any information about the convergence or
divergence of the series. In this case it is often useful to employ a more delicate test. Here is
one that is frequently useful.
9.2.8 Raabe’s Test Let X :¼ (xn) be a sequence of nonzero real numbers.
(a) If there exist numbers a &gt; 1 and K 2 N such that
#
#
#xnþ1 #

#
#
for n # K;
ð10Þ

P
then
xn is absolutely convergent.
(b) If there exist real numbers a # 1 and K 2 N such that

ð11Þ
# x ##1#n

P
then
xn is not absolutely convergent.

&amp;

Proof. (a) If the inequality (10) holds, then we have (after replacing n by k and
multiplying)
kjxkþ1 j # ðk # 1Þjxk j # ða # 1Þjxk j

for

k # K:

On reorganizing the inequality, we have
ð12Þ

ðk # 1Þjxk j # kjxkþ1 j # ða # 1Þjxk j &gt; 0

for

k # K;

from which we deduce that the sequence (kjxkþ1j) is decreasing for k # K. If we add (12)
for k ¼ K, . . . , n and note that the left side telescopes, we get
ðK # 1ÞjxK j # njxnþ1 j # ða # 1ÞðjxK j þ # # # þ jxn jÞ:
P
This shows (why?) that the partial sums of jxn j are bounded and establishes the absolute
convergence of the series.

(b) If the relation (11) holds for n # K, then since a # 1, we have
njxnþ1 j # ðn # aÞjxn j # ðn # 1Þjxn j

for

n#K:

Therefore the sequence (njxnþ1j) is increasing for n # K and there
P exists a number c &gt; 0

since
the

jxn j also diverges.
Q.E.D.
In the application of Raabe’s Test, it is often convenient to use the following limiting
form.
9.2.9 Corollary Let X :¼ (xn) be a nonzero sequence in R and let
#
###
# #
#xnþ1 #
#
# ;
ð13Þ
a :¼ lim n 1 # #
xn #
P
whenever this limit exists. Then
xn is absolutely convergent when a &gt; 1 and is not
absolutely convergent when a &lt; 1.
Proof. Suppose the limit in (13) exists and that a &gt; 1. If a1 is any number with a &gt; a1 &gt; 1,
then there exists K 2 N such that a1 &lt; n(1 # jxnþ1=xnj) for n &gt; K. Therefore jxnþ1=xnj &lt; 1 #
a1=n for n # K and Raabe’s Test 9.2.8(a) applies.
The case where a &lt; 1 is similar and is left to the reader.
Q.E.D.
Note There is no conclusion when a ¼ 1; either convergence or divergence is possible, as
the reader can show.
9.2.10 Examples (a) We reconsider the p-series in the light of Raabe’s Test. Applying
L’Hospital’s Rule when p # 1, we obtain (why?)
# #
#
# #
#
ð n þ 1Þ p # np

ð1 þ 1=nÞp
We conclude that if p &gt; 1 then the p-series is convergent, and if 0 &lt; p &lt; 1 then the series is
divergent (since the terms are positive). However, if p ¼ 1 (the harmonic series!), Corollary
9.2.9 yields no information.

(b) We now consider
2
n¼1 n þ 1
An easy calculation shows that lim(xnþ1=xn) ¼ 1, so that Corollary 9.2.5 does not
apply. Also, we have lim(n(1 # xnþ1=xn)) ¼ 1, so that Corollary 9.2.9 does not apply either.
However, it is an exercise to establish the inequality xnþ1=xn # (n # 1)=n, from which it
follows from Raabe’s Test 9.2.8(b) that the series is divergent. (Of course, the Integral Test,
&amp;
or the Limit Comparison Test with (yn) ¼ (1=n), can be applied here.)
Although the limiting form 9.2.9 of Raabe’s Test is much easier to apply, Example
9.2.10(b) shows that the form 9.2.8 is stronger than 9.2.9.
Remark Leonard Euler’s calculational prowess was remarkable, including his work in
the area of infinite series. His methods are not covered in this book, but we will state one of

CHAPTER 9 INFINITE SERIES

that are convergent but not absolutely convergent, it is desirable to have some tests for this
phenomenon. In this short section we shall present first the test for alternating series and
then tests for more general series due to Dirichlet and Abel.
Alternating Series
The most familiar test for nonabsolutely convergent series is the one due to Leibniz that is
applicable to series that are ‘‘alternating’’ in the following sense.
9.3.1 Definition A sequence X :¼ (xn) of nonzero real numbers is said to be alternating
if the terms ð#1Þnþ1 xn ; n 2 N, are all positive (or
Pall negative) real numbers. If the sequence
X ¼ (xn) is alternating, we say that the series
xn it generates is an alternating series.
In the case of an alternating series, it is useful to set xn ¼ (#1)nþ1zn [or xn ¼ (#1)nzn],
where zn &gt; 0 for all n 2 N.
9.3.2 Alternating Series Test Let Z :¼ (zn) be a decreasing
of strictly posiP sequence
tive numbers with limðzn Þ ¼ 0. Then the alternating series
ð#1Þnþ1 zn is convergent.
Proof. Since we have
s2n ¼ ðz1 # z2 Þ þ ðz3 # z4 Þ þ # # # þ ðz2n#1 # z2n Þ;
and since zk # zkþ1 # 0, it follows that the subsequence (s2n) of partial sums is increasing.
Since
s2n ¼ z1 # ðz2 # z3 Þ # # # # # ðz2n#2 # z2n#1 Þ # z2n ;
it also follows that s2n # z1 for all n 2 N. It follows from the Monotone Convergence
Theorem 3.3.2 that the subsequence (s2n ) converges to some number s 2 R.
We now show that the entire sequence (sn) converges to s. Indeed, if e &gt; 0, let K be
such that if n # K then js2n # sj # 12 e and jz2nþ1 j # 12 e. It follows that if n # K then
js2nþ1 # sj ¼ js2n þ z2nþ1 # sj
# js2n # sj þ jz2nþ1 j # 12 e þ 12 e ¼ e:
Therefore every partial sum of an odd number of terms is also within e of
is large
Ps if n nþ1
ð#1Þ zn is
enough. Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, the convergence of (sn) and hence of
established.
Q.E.D.
Note It is an exercise to show that if s is the sum of the alternating series and if sn is its nth
partial sum, then
ð2Þ

js # sn j # znþ1 :

It is clear that this Alternating Series Test establishes the convergence of the two series
already mentioned, in (1).
The Dirichlet and Abel Tests
We will now present two other tests of wide applicability. They are based on the following
lemma, which is sometimes called the partial summation formula, since it corresponds to
the familiar formula for integration by parts.

9.3.3 Abel’s

m
X
xk ðsk # sk#1 Þ. If we collect the terms multiplying sn, snþ1, . . . , sm, we obtain the
k¼nþ1

right side of (3).

Q.E.D.

P We now apply Abel’s Lemma to obtain tests for convergence of series of the form
xn yn .
9.3.4 Dirichlet’s Test
P If X :¼ (xn) is a decreasing sequence
P with lim xn ¼ 0, and if the
partial sums (sn) of
yn are bounded, then the series
xn yn is convergent.
Proof. Let jsn j # B for all n 2 N. If m &gt; n, it follows from Abel’s Lemma 9.3.3 and the
fact that xk # xkþ1 # 0 that

¼ 2xnþ1 B:
P
Since lim(xk) ¼ 0, the convergence of
xk yk follows from the Cauchy Convergence
Criterion 3.7.4.
Q.E.D.
9.3.5 Abel’s Test If X :¼ (xnP
) is a convergent monotone sequence and the series
is convergent, then the series
xn yn is also convergent.

P

yn

Proof. If (xn) is decreasing with limit x, let un :¼ xn # x, n 2 N, so that (un) decreases to 0.
Then xn ¼ x þ un, whence xnyn P
¼ xyn þ unyn. It follows from the Dirichlet Test 9.3.4 that
P
and,
since
xy
un yn is convergent
P
Pn converges (because of the assumed convergence of
the series
yn ), we conclude that
xn yn is convergent.
If (xn) is increasing with limit x, let vn :¼ x # xn, n 2 N, so that (vn) decreases to 0. Here
xn ¼ x # vn, whence xnyn ¼ xyn # vnyn, and the argument proceeds as before.
Q.E.D.
9.3.6 Examples (a) Since we have
2ðsin 12 xÞ ðcos x þ # # # þ cos nxÞ ¼ sinðn þ 12Þx # sin 12 x;
it follows that if x 6¼ 2kp ðk 2 NÞ, then
jcos x þ # # # þ cos nxj ¼

jsinðn þ 12Þx # sin 12 xj
1
#
:
1
j2 sin 2 xj

Hence Dirichlet’s Test implies that if (an) is decreasing with lim(an) ¼ 0, then the series

an cos nx converges provided x 6¼ 2kp.

Section 9.4 Series of Functions
Because of their frequent appearance and importance, we now present a discussion of infinite
series of functions. Since the convergence of an infinite series is handled by examining the
sequence of partial sums, questions concerning series of functions are answered by examining
corresponding questions for sequences of functions. For this reason, a portion of the present
section is merely a translation of facts already established for sequences of functions into
series terminology. However, in the second part of the section, where we discuss power series,
some new features arise because of the special character of the functions involved.
9.4.1 Definition If ( fn) is a sequence of functions defined on
Pa subset D of R with values
in R, the sequence of partial sums (sn) of the infinite series f n is defined for x in D by
s1 ðxÞ :¼ f 1 ðxÞ;
s2 ðxÞ :¼ s1 ðxÞ þ f 2 ðxÞ
. . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
snþ1 ðxÞ :¼ sn ðxÞ þ f nþ1 ðxÞ
. . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In case the sequenceP
(sn) of functions converges on D to a function f, we say that the infinite
series of functions
f n converges to f on D. We will often write
1
X
X
fn
or
fn
n¼1

to denote either the series or the limit function, when it exists.
P
P
If the series
j f n ðxÞj converges for each x in D, we say that
f n is absolutely
convergent
on
D.
If
the
sequence
(s
)
of
partial
sums
is
uniformly
convergent
on D to f, we
n
P
say that
f n is uniformly convergent on D, or that it converges to f uniformly on D.
One of the main reasons for the interest in uniformly convergent series of functions is
the validity of the following results, which give conditions justifying the change of order of
the summation and other limiting operations.
9.4.2 Theorem If fn is continuous on D R to R for each n 2 N and if
to f uniformly on D, then f is continuous on D.

CHAPTER 9 INFINITE SERIES

This is a direct translation of Theorem 8.2.2 for series. The next result is a translation
of Theorem 8.2.4.
9.4.3 Theorem Suppose that the real-valued
P functions fn , n 2 N, are Riemann integrable on the interval J :¼ [a, b]. If the series
f n converges to f uniformly on J, then f is
Riemann integrable and

Next we turn to the corresponding theorem pertaining to differentiation. Here we
assume the uniform convergence of the series obtained after term-by-term differentiation
of the given series. This result is an immediate consequence of Theorem 8.2.3.
9.4.4 Theorem For each n 2 N , let fn beP
a real-valued junction on J :¼ [a, b] that has a
derivative f 0n on J. Suppose that
the
series
f n converges for at least one point of J and
P 0
that the series of derivatives
f n converges uniformly on P
J.
Then there exists a real-valued function f on J such
that
f n converges uniformly on
P 0
J to f. In addition, f has a derivative on J and f 0 ¼
f n.
Tests for Uniform Convergence
Since we have stated some consequences of uniform convergence of series, we shall now
present a few tests that can be used to establish uniform convergence.
9.4.5
P Cauchy Criterion Let ( fn) be a sequence of functions on D R to R. The series
f n is uniformly convergent on D if and only if for every e &gt; 0 there exists an M(e) such
that if m &gt; n # M(e), then

Q.E.D.

In Appendix E we will use the Weierstrass M-Test to construct two interesting examples.
Power Series
We shall now turn to a discussion of power series. This is an important class of series of
functions and enjoys properties that are not valid for general series of functions.
9.4.7 Definition A series of real functions
x ¼ c if the function fn has the form

P

f n is said to be a power series around

f n ðxÞ ¼ an ðx # cÞn ;
where an and c belong to R and where n ¼ 0, 1, 2, . . . .

9.4 SERIES OF FUNCTIONS

283

For the sake of simplicity of our notation, we shall treat only the case where c ¼ 0. This
is no loss of generality, however, since the translation x0 ¼ x # c reduces a power series
around c to a power series around 0. Thus, whenever we refer to a power series, we shall
mean a series of the form
ð2Þ

X

an xn ¼ a0 þ a1 x þ # # # þ an xn þ # # # :

n¼0

Even though the functions appearing in (2) are defined over all of R, it is not to be
expected that the series (2) will converge for all x in R. For example, by using the Ratio
Test 9.2.4, we can show that the series

converge for x in the sets
f0g;

fx 2 R : jxj &lt; 1g; R;

respectively. Thus, the set on which a power series converges may be small, medium, or
large. However, an arbitrary subset of R cannot be the precise set on which a power series
converges, as we shall show.
If (bn) is a bounded sequence of nonnegative real numbers, then we define the limit
superior of (bn) to be the infimum of those numbers v such that bn # v for all sufficiently
large n 2 N. This infimum is uniquely determined and is denoted by lim sup(bn). The only
facts we need to know are (i) that if v &gt; lim sup(bn), then bn # v for all sufficiently large
n 2 N, and (ii) that if w &lt; lim sup(bn), then w # bn for infinitely many n 2 N. (See 3.4.10
and 3.4.11.)
P
9.4.8 Definition Let an xn be a power series. If the sequence ðjan j1=n Þ is bounded, we
set r :¼ lim supðjan j1=n Þ; ifP
this sequence is not bounded we set r ¼ þ1. We define the
radius of convergence of
an xn to be given by
8
if r ¼ þ1;
&lt;0
R :¼ 1=r if 0 &lt; r &lt; þ1;
:
þ1 if r ¼ 0:
The interval of convergence is the open interval (#R, R).
We shall now justify the term ‘‘radius of convergence.’’
9.4.9 Cauchy-Hadamard
Theorem If R is the radius of convergence of the power
P
series
an xn , then the series is absolutely convergent if jxj &lt; R and is divergent if
jxj &gt; R.
Proof. We shall treat only the case where 0 &lt; R &lt; þ1, leaving the cases R ¼ 0 and
R ¼ þ1 as exercises. If 0 &lt; jxj &lt; R, then there exists a positive number c &lt; 1 such that
jxj &lt; cR. Therefore r &lt; c=jxj and so it follows that if n is sufficiently large, then
jan j1=n # c=jxj. This is equivalent to the statement that
ð3Þ

jan xn j # cn

for all sufficiently large n. Since c &lt; 1, the absolute convergence of

whether the power series converges when jxj ¼ R. Indeed, anything can happen, as the

The first power series converges at neither of the points x ¼ #1 and x ¼ þ1; the second
series converges at x ¼ #1 but diverges at x ¼ þ1; and the third power series converges at
both x ¼ #1 and x ¼ þ1. (Find a power series with R ¼ 1 that converges at x ¼ þ1 but
diverges x ¼ #1.)

9.4.10 Theorem Let R be the radius of convergence of an xn and let K be a closed and
bounded interval contained in the interval of convergence (#R, R). Then the power series
converges uniformly on K.
Proof. The hypothesis on K ð#R; RÞ implies that there exists a positive constant c &lt; 1
such that jxj &lt; cR for all x 2 K. (Why?) By the argument in 9.4.9, we infer that for
sufficiently largePn, the estimate (3) holds for all x 2 K. Since c &lt; 1, the uniform
convergence of
an xn on K is a direct consequence of the Weierstrass M-test with
M n :¼ cn .
Q.E.D.
9.4.11 Theorem The limit of a power series is continuous on the interval of convergence. A power series can be integrated term-by-term over any closed and bounded
interval contained in the interval of convergence.
P
Proof. If jx0 j &lt; R, then the preceding result asserts that an xn converges uniformly on
any closed and bounded neighborhood of x0 contained in (#R, R). The continuity at x0 then
follows from Theorem 9.4.2, and the term-by-term integration is justified by Theorem
9.4.3.
Q.E.D.
We now show that a power series can be differentiated term-by-term. Unlike the
situation for general series, we do not need to assume that the differentiated series is
uniformly convergent. Hence this result is stronger than Theorem 9.4.4.

Both series have the same radius of convergence.
Proof. Since lim(n1=n) ¼ 1, the sequence ðjnan j1=n Þ is bounded if and only if the sequence
ðjan j1=n Þ is bounded. Moreover, it is easily seen that
lim sup jnan j1=n ¼ lim sup jan j1=n :
Therefore, the radius of convergence of the two series is the same, so the formally
differentiated series is uniformly convergent on each closed and bounded interval contained
in the interval of convergence. We can then apply Theorem 9.4.4 to conclude that the
formally differentiated series converges to the derivative of the given series.
Q.E.D.
Remark It is to be observed that the theorem makes no assertion about the endpoints of
the interval of convergence. If a series is convergent at an endpoint, then the differentiated

series may or may not be convergent at this point. For example, the series
xn =n2

converges at both endpoints x ¼ #1 and x ¼ þ1. However, the differentiated series given

CHAPTER 10

THE GENERALIZED
RIEMANN INTEGRAL

In Chapter 7 we gave a rather complete discussion of the Riemann integral of a function on
a closed bounded interval, defining the integral as the limit of Riemann sums of the
function. This is the integral (and the approach) that the reader met in calculus courses; it is
also the integral that is most frequently used in applications to engineering and other areas.
We have seen that continuous and monotone functions on [a, b] are Riemann integrable, so
most of the functions arising in calculus are included in its scope.
However, by the end of the nineteenth century, some inadequacies in the Riemann
theory of integration had become apparent. These failings came primarily from the fact that
the collection of Riemann integrable functions became inconveniently small as mathematics
developed. For example, the set of functions for which the Newton–Leibniz formula,
Z b
F 0 ¼ FðbÞ # FðaÞ;
a

holds does not include all differentiable functions. Also, limits of sequences of Riemann
integrable functions are not necessarily Riemann integrable. These inadequacies led others
to invent other integration theories, the best known of which was due to Henri Lebesgue
(1875–1941) and was developed at the very beginning of the twentieth century. (For an
account of the history of the development of the Lebesgue integral, the reader should
consult the book by Hawkins given in the References.)
Indeed, the Lebesgue theory of integration has become pre-eminent in contemporary
mathematical research, since it enables one to integrate a much larger collection of
functions, and to take limits of integrals more freely. However, the Lebesgue integral also
has several inadequacies and difficulties: (1) There exist functions F that are differentiable
on [a, b] but such that F 0 is not Lebesgue integrable. (2) Some ‘‘improper integrals,’’ such
as the important Dirichlet integral,
Z 1
sin x
dx;
x
0
do not exist as Lebesgue integrals. (3) Most treatments of the Lebesgue integral have
considerable prerequisites and are not easily within the reach of an undergraduate student
of mathematics.
As important as the Lebesgue integral is, there are even more inclusive theories of
integration. One of these was developed independently in the late 1950s by the Czech
mathematician Jaroslav Kurzweil (b. 1926) and the English mathematician Ralph
Henstock (b. 1923). Surprisingly, their approach is only slightly different from that
used by Riemann, yet it yields an integral (which we will call the generalized Riemann
integral ) that includes both the Riemann and the Lebesgue integrals as special cases. Since
the approach is so similar to that of Riemann, it is technically much simpler than the usual

Ralph Henstock and Jaroslav Kurzweil
Ralph Henstock (1923–2007), pictured on the left, was
born in Nottinghamshire, England, the son of a mineworker. At an early age he showed that he was a gifted
scholar in mathematics and science. He entered St. John’s
College, Cambridge, in 1941, studying with J. D. Bernal,
G. H. Hardy, and J. C. Burkhill and was classified
Wrangler in Part II of the Tripos Exams in 1943. He
earned his B.A. at Cambridge in 1944 and his Ph.D. at the
University of London in 1948. His research is in the theory
of summability, linear analysis, and integration theory.
Most of his teaching was in Northern Ireland.
Jaroslav Kurzweil (pictured on the right) was born on May 7, 1926, in Prague. A student of
V. Jarnik, he has done a considerable amount of research in the theory of differential equations and
the theory of integration, and also has had a serious interest in mathematical education. In 1964 he
was awarded the Klement Gottwald State Prize, and in 1981 he was awarded the Bolzano medal
of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. Since 1989 he has been Director of the Mathematical
Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague and has had a profound influence on the
mathematicians there. In 2006, he was awarded the ‘‘Czech Mind,’’ the highest scientific prize of
the Czech Republic.

Lebesgue integral—yet its scope is considerably greater; in particular, it includes functions
that are derivatives, and also includes all ‘‘improper integrals.’’
In this chapter, we give an exposition of the generalized Riemann integral. In Section
10.1, it will be seen that the basic theory is almost exactly the same as for the ordinary
Riemann integral. However, we have omitted the proofs of a few results when their proofs
are unduly complicated. In the short Section 10.2, we indicate that improper integrals on
[a, b] are included in the generalized theory. We will introduce the class of Lebesgue
integrable functions as those generalized integrable functions f whose absolute value j f j is
also generalized integrable; this is a very different approach to the Lebesgue integral than is
usual, but it gives the same class of functions. In Section 10.3, we will integrate functions
on unbounded closed intervals. In the final section, we discuss the limit theorems that hold
for the generalized Riemann and Lebesgue integrals, and we will give some interesting
applications of these theorems. We will also define what is meant by a ‘‘measurable
function’’ and relate that notion to generalized integrability.
Readers wishing to study the proofs that are omitted here should consult the first
author’s book, A Modern Theory of Integration, which we refer to as [MTI], or the books of
DePree and Swartz, Gordon, and McLeod listed in the References.

Section 10.1 Definition and Main Properties
In Definition 5.5.2, we defined a gauge on [a, b] to be a strictly positive function d : [a; b] !

CHAPTER 10 THE GENERALIZED RIEMANN INTEGRAL

This is shown in Figure 5.5.1. Note that (i) only a tagged partition can be d-fine, and (ii) the
d-fineness of a tagged partition depends on the choice of the tags ti and the values dðti Þ.
In Examples 5.5.4, we gave some specific examples of gauges, and in Theorem 5.5.5
we showed that if d is any gauge on [a, b], then there exist d-fine tagged partitions of [a, b].
We will define the generalized Riemann (or the ‘‘Henstock–Kurzweil’’) integral. It
will be seen that the definition is very similar to that of the ordinary Riemann integral, and
that many of the proofs are essentially the same. Indeed, the only difference between the
definitions of these integrals is that the notion of smallness of a tagged partition is specified
by a gauge, rather than its norm. It will be seen that this—apparently minor—difference
results in a very much larger class of integrable functions. In order to avoid some
complications, a few proofs will be omitted; they can be found in [MTI].
Before we begin our study, it is appropriate that we ask: Why are gauges more useful
than norms? Briefly, the reason is that the norm of a partition is a rather coarse measure of
the fineness of the partition, since it is merely the length of the largest subinterval in the
partition. On the other hand, gauges can give one more delicate control of the subintervals
in the partitions, by requiring the use of small subinterals when the function is varying
rapidly but permitting the use of larger subintervals when the function is nearly constant.
Moreover, gauges can be used to force specific points to be tags; this is often useful when
unusual behavior takes place at such a point. Since gauges are more flexible than norms,
their use permits a larger class of functions to become integrable.
10.1.1 Definition A function f : ½a; b# ! R is said to be generalized Riemann integrable on [a, b] if there exists a number L 2 R such that for every e &gt; 0 there exists a gauge de
on [a, b] such that if P_ is any de -fine partition of [a, b], then
#
jSð f ; PÞ # Lj &lt; e:
The collection of all generalized Riemann integrable functions will usually be denoted by
R# ½a; b#.
It will be shown that if f 2 R# ½a; b#, then the number L is uniquely determined; it will
be called the generalized Riemann integral of f over [a, b]. It will also be shown that if
f 2 R½a; b#, then f 2 R# ½a; b# and the value of the two integrals is the same. Therefore, it
will not cause any ambiguity if we also denote the generalized Riemann integral of f 2
R# ½a; b# by the symbols
Z b
Z b
f
or
f ðxÞ dx:

Our first result gives the uniqueness of the value of the generalized Riemann integral.
Although its proof is almost identical to that of Theorem 7.1.2, we will write it out to show
how gauges are used instead of norms of partitions.
10.1.2 Uniqueness Theorem If f 2 R# ½a; b#, then the value of the integral is uniquely
determined.
Proof. Assume that L0 and L00 both satisfy the definition and let e &gt; 0. Thus there exists a
gauge d0e=2 such that if P_ 1 is any d0e=2 -fine partition, then
# # #
jS f ; P 1 # L0 j &lt; e=2:


C10

Also there exists a gauge d00e=2 such that if P_ 2 is any d00e=2 -fine partition, then
# # #
jS f ; P 2 # L00 j &lt; e=2:
n
o
We define de by de ðtÞ :¼ min d0e=2 ðtÞ; d00e=2 ðtÞ for t 2 ½a; b#, so that de is a gauge on ½a; b#.
If P_ is a de -fine partition, then the partition P_ is both d0e=2 -fine and d00e=2 -fine, so that
# ##
# ##
and
jS f ; P # L00 j &lt; e=2;

whence it follows that
# ##
# ##
jL0 # L00 j # jL0 # S f ; P j þ jS f ; P # L00 j
&lt; e=2 þ e=2 ¼ e:
Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, it follows that L0 ¼ L00 .

Q.E.D.

We now show that every Riemann integrable function f is also generalized Riemann
integrable, and with the same value for the integral. This is done by using a gauge that is a
constant function.
10.1.3 Consistency Theorem If f 2 R½a; b# with integral L, then also f 2 R# ½a; b# with
integral L.
Proof. Given e &gt; 0, we need to construct an appropriate gauge on [a, b]. Since
f 2 R½a; b#, there exists a number de &gt; 0 such that if P_ is any tagged partition with
## ##
# #
#
#
##P_ ## &lt; de , then #S f ; P_ # L# &lt; e. We define the function d# ðtÞ :¼ 1 de for t 2 ½a; b#, so that
e
4
d#e is a gauge on [a, b].
If P_ ¼ fðI i ; ti Þgni¼1 , where I i :¼ ½xi#1 ; xi #, is a d#e -fine partition, then since
#
# #
#
I i # ti # d#e ðti Þ; ti þ d#e ðti Þ ¼ ti # 14 de ; ti þ 14 de ;
it is readily seen that 0 &lt; xi # xi#1 # 12 de &lt; de for all i ¼ 1; . . . ; n. Therefore this partition
#
#
## ##
_ # L# &lt; e.
also satisfies ##P_ ## &lt; de and consequently #Sð f : PÞ
#
#
#
#
Thus every d#e -fine partition P_ also satisfies #S f : P_ # L# &lt; e. Since e &gt; 0 is
arbitrary, it follows that f is generalized Riemann integrable to L.
Q.E.D.
From Theorems 7.2.5, 7.2.7, and 7.2.8, we conclude that: Every step function, every
continuous function, and every monotone function belongs to R# ½a; b#. We will now show
that Dirichlet’s function, which was shown not to be Riemann integrable in 7.2.2(b) and
7.3.13(d), is generalized Riemann integrable.
10.1.4 Examples (a) The Dirichlet function f belongs to R# ½0; 1# and has integral 0.
We enumerate the rational numbers in [0, 1] as frk g1
k¼1 . Given e &gt; 0 we define de ðrk Þ
:¼ e=2kþ2 and de ðxÞ :¼ 1 when x is irrational. Thus de is a gauge on [0,1] and if the
partition P_ :¼ fðI i ; ti Þgni¼1 #is de -fine,
then we have xi # xi#1 # 2de ðti Þ. Since the only

Q.E.D.
It might be expected that an argument similar to that given in Theorem 7.1.6 can be
used to show that a function in R# ½a; b# is necessarily bounded. However, that is not the
case; indeed, we have already seen an unbounded function in R# ½0; 1# in Example 10.1.4(b)
and will encounter more later. However, it is a profitable exercise for the reader to
determine exactly where the proof of Theorem 7.1.6 breaks down for a function in R# ½a; b#.
The Cauchy Criterion
There is an analogous form for the Cauchy Criterion for functions in R# ½a; b#. It is
important because it eliminates the need to know the value of the integral. Its proof is
essentially the same as that of 7.2.1.
10.1.6 Cauchy Criterion A function f : ½a; b# ! R belongs to R# ½a; b# if and only if for

The Additivity Theorem
We now present a result quite analogous to Theorem 7.2.9. Its proof is a modification of the
proof of that theorem, but since it is somewhat technical, the reader may choose to omit the
proof on a first reading.

The equality (3) now follows from the first part of the theorem.
Q.E.D.
It is easy to see that results exactly similar to 7.2.10–7.2.13 hold for the generalized
Riemann integral. We leave their statements to the reader, but will use these results freely.
The Fundamental Theorem (First Form)
We will now give versions of the Fundamental Theorems for the generalized Riemann
integral. It will be seen that the First Form is significantly stronger than for the (ordinary)
Riemann integral; indeed, we will show that the derivative of any function automatically
belongs to R# ½a; b#, so the integrability of the function becomes a conclusion, rather than a
hypothesis.
10.1.9 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (First Form) Suppose there exists a
countable set E in [a, b], and functions f ; F : ½a; b# ! R such that:
(a) F is continuous on [a, b].

CHAPTER 10 THE GENERALIZED RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Thus, we assume that (b) holds for all x 2 ½a; b#. Since we wish to show that
f 2 R# ½a; b#, given e &gt; 0, we need to construct a gauge de ; this will be done by using
the differentiability of F on [a, b]. If t 2 I, since the derivative f ðtÞ ¼ F 0 ðtÞ exists, there

see Exercises 18 and 20. However, we will state a theorem in this direction that is often
useful. Its proof will be found in [MTI].

usually have F 0 ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ and G0 ðxÞ ¼ gðxÞ for all x 2 ½a; b#. It will be noted that we need
to assume that one of the functions f G ¼ F 0 G and Fg ¼ FG0 belongs to R# ½a; b#.
The reader should contrast the next result with Theorem 7.3.18. Note that we do not
need to assume the integrability of f ðnþ1Þ .

CHAPTER 10 THE GENERALIZED RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Section 10.2 Improper and Lebesgue Integrals
We have seen in Theorem 7.1.6 that a function f in R½a; b# must be bounded on [a, b]
(although this need not be the case for a function in R# ½a; b#). In order to integrate certain
functions that have infinite limits at a point c in [a, b], or that are highly oscillatory at such a
point, one learns in calculus to take limits of integrals over subintervals, as the endpoints of
these subintervals tend to the point c. pﬃﬃﬃ
For example, the function hðxÞ :¼ 1= x for x 2 ð0; 1# and hð0Þ :¼ 0 is unbounded on
a neighborhood of the left endpoint of [0, 1]. However, it does belong to R½g; 1# for every
g 2 ð0; 1# and we define the ‘‘improper Riemann integral’’ of h on [0, 1] to be the limit

We would treat the oscillatory function kðxÞ :¼ sinð1=xÞ for x 2 ð0; 1# and kð0Þ :¼ 0 in
the same way.
One handles a function that becomes unbounded, or is highly oscillatory, at the right
endpoint of the interval in a similar fashion. Furthermore, if a function g is unbounded, or is
highly oscillatory, near some c 2 ða; bÞ, then we define the ‘‘improper Riemann integral’’
to be

ﬃﬃﬃ
then H 0 ðxÞ ¼ 1= x ¼: hðxÞ for x 2 ð0; 1# and the Fundamental Theorem 10.1.9 asserts

This example is an instance of a remarkable theorem due to Heinrich Hake, which we now
state in the case where the function becomes unbounded or is oscillatory near the right
endpoint of the interval.
10.2.1 Hake’s Theorem If f : ½a; b# ! R, then f 2 R# ½a; b# if and only if for every g 2

f 2 R# ½a; b#, we need to construct gauges on [a, b]. This is done by carefully ‘‘piecing
together’’ gauges that work for the intervals ½g i#1 ; g i # to obtain a gauge on [a, b]. Since the
details of this construction are somewhat delicate and not particularly informative, we will
not go through them here but refer the reader to [MTI].

It is important to understand the significance of Hake’s Theorem.
It implies that the generalized Riemann integral cannot be extended by taking limits as
in (2). Indeed, if a function f has the property that its restriction to every subinterval
[a, g], where g 2 ða; bÞ, is generalized Riemann integrable and such that (2) holds, then
f already belongs to R# ½a; b#.
An alternative way of expressing this fact is that the generalized Riemann integral does
not need to be extended by taking such limits.
One can test a function for integrability on [a, b] by examining its behavior on
subintervals [a, g] with g &lt; b. Since it is usually difficult to establish that a function
is in R# ½a; b# by using Definition 10.1.1, this fact gives us another tool for showing that a
function is generalized Riemann integrable on [a, b].
It is often useful to evaluate the integral of a function by using (2).
We will use these observations to give an important example that provides insight into
the set of generalized Riemann integrable functions.

k¼1

absolute values do not belong to R# ½0; 1#. We have already encountered such functions in
&amp;

Exercises 10.1.19 and 10.1.21.

The fact that there are generalized Riemann integrable functions whose absolute value is
not generalized Riemann integrable is often summarized by saying that the generalized
Riemann integral is not an ‘‘absolute integral.’’ Thus, in passing to the generalized Riemann
integral we lose an important property of the (ordinary) Riemann integral. But that is the price
that one must pay in order to be able to integrate a much larger class of functions.
Lebesgue Integrable Functions
In view of the importance of the subset of functions in R# ½a; b# whose absolute values also
belong to R# ½a; b#, we will introduce the following definition.
10.2.3 Definition A function f 2 R# ½a; b# such that j f j 2 R# ½a; b# is said to be Lebesgue integrable on [a, b]. The collection of all Lebesgue integrable functions on [a, b] is
denoted by L½a; b#.
Note The collection of all Lebesgue integrable functions is usually introduced in a totally
different manner. One of the advantages of the generalized Riemann integral is that it
includes the collection of Lebesgue integrable functions as a special—and easily identifiable—collection of functions.
It is clear that if f 2 R# ½a; b# and if f ðxÞ # 0 for all x 2 ½a; b#, then we have
j f j ¼ f 2 R# ½a; b#, so that f 2 L½a; b#. That is, a nonnegative function f 2 R# ½a; b#
belongs to L½a; b#. The next result gives a more powerful test for a function in R# ½a; b#
to belong to L½a; b#.
10.2.4 Comparison Test If f ; v 2 R# ½a; b# and j f ðxÞj # vðxÞ for all x 2 ½a; b#, then

whence the first inequality in (3) follows. The second inequality follows from another
application of 10.1.5 (c).

belong to L½a; b#.

The next result asserts that one only needs to establish a one-sided inequality in order
to show that a function f 2 R# ½a; b# actually belongs to L½a; b#.

(a) f 2 L½a; b#.
(b) There exists v 2 L½a; b# such that f ðxÞ # vðxÞ for all x 2 ½a; b#.
(c) There exists a 2 L½a; b# such that aðxÞ # f ðxÞ for all x 2 ½a; b#.
Proof. (a) ) (b) Let v :¼ f .
(b) ) (a) Note that f ¼ v # ðv # f Þ. Since v # f # 0 and since v # f belongs to

We leave the proof that (a) () (c) to the reader.

If f ; g 2 L½a; b#, then the functions maxf f ; gg and minf f ; gg also

maxf f ðxÞ; gðxÞg ¼ 12 ð f ðxÞ þ gðxÞ þ j f ðxÞ # gðxÞjÞ;
minf f ðxÞ; gðxÞg ¼ 12 ð f ðxÞ þ gðxÞ # j f ðxÞ # gðxÞjÞ:
The assertions follow from these equations and Theorem 10.2.5.

In fact, the preceding result gives a useful conclusion about the maximum and the
minimum of two functions in R# ½a; b#.

a # f ; a # g;

then maxf f ; gg and minf f ; gg also belong to R# ½a; b#.
Proof. Suppose that f # v and g # v; then maxf f ; gg # v. It follows from the first
equality in the proof of Theorem 10.2.7 that
0 # j f # gj ¼ 2 maxf f ; gg # f # g # 2v # f # g:
Since 2v # f # g # 0, this function belongs to L½a; b#. The Comparison Test 10.2.4

The second part of the assertion is proved similarly.
Q.E.D.
The Seminorm in L½a; b#
We will now define the ‘‘seminorm’’ of a function in L½a; b# and the ‘‘distance between’’
two such functions.

If f ; g 2 L½a; b#, we define the distance between f and g to be

These assertions follow from the corresponding ones in Theorem 10.2.10. Their proofs

This notion of convergence can be used exactly as we have used the distance function in R
for the convergence of sequences of real numbers.
We will conclude this section with a statement of the Completeness Theorem for
L½a; b# (also called the Riesz-Fischer Theorem). It plays the same role in the space L½a; b#
that the Completeness Property plays in R.
10.2.12 Completeness Theorem A sequence ð f n Þ of functions in L½a; b# converges to a

The direction ()) is very easy to prove and is left as an exercise. A proof of the direction (()
is more involved, but can be based on the following idea: Find a subsequence ðgk Þ :¼ ð f nk Þ of

ðgkþ1 ðxÞ # gk ðxÞÞ, where

this series is absolutely convergent, and f ðxÞ :¼ 0 elsewhere. It can then be shown that f 2

Section 10.3 Infinite Intervals
In the preceding two sections, we have discussed the integration of functions defined on
bounded closed intervals [a, b]. However, in applications we often want to integrate
functions defined on unbounded closed intervals, such as
½a; 1Þ;

ð#1; b#;

or ð#1; 1Þ:

In calculus, the standard approach is to define an integral over [a, 1) as a limit:
Z 1
Z g
f :¼ lim
f;
a

g!1

a

and to define integrals over the other infinite intervals similarly. In this section, we will treat
the generalized Riemann integrable (and Lebesgue integrable) functions defined on infinite
intervals.
In defining the generalized Riemann integral of a function f on [a, 1), we will
_ :¼
adopt a somewhat different procedure from that in calculus. We note that if Q
fð½x0 ; x1 #; t1 Þ; . . . ; ð½xn#1 ; xn #; tn Þ; ð½xn ; 1#; tnþ1 Þg is a tagged partition of [a, 1], then
_ has the form:
x0 ¼ a and xnþ1 ¼ 1 and the Riemann sum corresponding to Q
ð1Þ

f ðt1 Þðx1 # x0 Þ þ # # # þ f ðtn Þðxn # xn#1 Þ þ f ðtnþ1 Þð1 # xn Þ:

Since the final term f ðtnþ1 Þð1 # xn Þ in (1) is not meaningful, we wish to suppress this
term. We can do this in two different ways: (i) define the Riemann sum to contain only the
first n terms, or (ii) have a procedure that will enable us to deal with the symbols 1 in
calculations in such a way that we eliminate the final term in (1).

We choose to adopt method (i): instead of dealing with partitions of [a, 1) into a finite
number of non-overlapping intervals (one of which must necessarily have infinite length), we
deal with certain subpartitions of [a, 1), which are finite collections of non-overlapping
intervals of finite length whose union is properly contained in [a, 1).
We define a gauge on [a, 1] to be an ordered pair consisting of a strictly positive
function d defined on [a, 1) and a number d# &gt; 0. When we say that a tagged subpartition
P_ :¼ fð½x0 ; x1 #; t1 Þ; . . . ; ð½xn#1 ; xn #; tn Þg is (d, d#)-fine, we mean that

or, equivalency, that

Note Ordinarily we consider a gauge on [a, 1] to be a strictly positive function d with
domain ½a; 1# :¼ ½a; 1Þ [ f1g where d(1) :¼ d#.
We will now define the generalized Riemann integral over [a, 1).
10.3.1 Definition (a) A function f : ½a; 1Þ ! R is said to be generalized Riemann
integrable if there exists A 2 R such that for every e &gt; 0 there exists
a gauge#de on [a, 1]

(b) A function f : ½a; 1Þ ! R is said to be Lebesgue integrable if both f and j f j belong
to R# ½a; 1Þ. In this case we write f 2 L½a; 1Þ.
Of particular importance is the version of Hake’s Theorem for functions in R# ½a; 1Þ.
Other results for functions in L½a; 1Þ will be given in the exercises.
10.3.2 Hake’s Theorem If f : ½a; 1Þ ! R, then f 2 R# ½a; 1Þ if and only if for every

The idea of the proof of Hake’s Theorem is as before; the details are given in [MTI].
The generalized Riemann integral on the unbounded interval [a, 1) has the same
properties as this integral on a bounded interval [a, b] that were demonstrated in
Section 10.1. They can be obtained by either modifying the proofs given there, or by
using Hake’s Theorem. We will give two examples.

Indeed, we define sðxÞ :¼ ak for x 2 ½k # 1; kÞ, k 2 N. It is clear that the restriction
of s to every subinterval [0, g] is a step function, and therefore belongs to R# ½0; g #.
Moreover, if g 2 ½n; n þ 1Þ, then

s ¼ a1 þ # # # þ an þ r g ;

But since jcos xj # 1, it is an exercise to show that the above terms approach 0 as b &lt; g

D 2 R# ½0; 1Þ.
However, it will be seen in Exercise 13 that jDj does not belong to R# ½0; 1Þ. Thus the
&amp;
function D does not belong to L½0; 1Þ.
We close this discussion of integrals over ½a; 1Þ with a version of the Fundamental
Theorem (First Form).
10.3.5 Fundamental Theorem Suppose that E is a countable subset of ½a; 1Þ and that
f, F : ½a; 1Þ ! R are such that:

Integrals over ð#1; b#
We now discuss integration over closed intervals that are unbounded below.
Let b 2 R and g : ð#1; b# ! R be a function that is to be integrated over the infinite
interval ð#1; b#. By a gauge on ½#1; b# we mean an ordered pair consisting of a number
d # &gt; 0 and a strictly positive function d on ð#1; bÞ. We say that a tagged subpartition

Here the Riemann sum of g for P_ is S g; P_ ¼

Finally, we say that g : ð#1; b# ! R is generalized Riemann integrable if there
exists B 2 R such that for every e &gt; 0 there#exists
a#gauge# de on ð#1; b# such that if P_ is
#
#

any de -fine subpartition of ð#1; b#, then S g; P # B# # e. In this case we write g 2

Z b
g ¼ B:

Similarly, a function g : ð#1; b# ! R is said to be Lebesgue integrable if both g and jgj
belong to R# ð#1; b#. In this case we will write g 2 Lð#1; b#.
The theorems valid for the integral over ½a; 1# are obtained in this case as well. Their
formulation will be left to the reader.
Integrals over ð#1; 1Þ
Let h : ð#1; 1Þ ! R be a function that we wish to integrate over the infinite interval

Similarly, a function h : ð#1; 1Þ ! R is said to be Lebesgue integrable if both h and jhj
belong to R# ð#1; 1Þ. In this case we write h 2 Lð#1; 1Þ.
In view of its importance, we will state the version of Hake’s Theorem that is valid for
the integral over (#1, 1).
10.3.6 Hake’s Theorem If h : ð#1; 1Þ ! R, then h 2 R# ð#1; 1Þ if and only if for

Section 10.4 Convergence Theorems
We will conclude our discussion of the generalized Riemann integral with an indication of
the convergence theorems that are available for it. It will be seen that the results are much
stronger than those presented in Section 8.2 for the (ordinary) Riemann integral. Finally,
we will introduce a ‘‘measurable’’ function on ½a; b# as the almost everywhere limit of a
sequence of step functions. We will show that every integrable function is measurable, and
that a measurable function on [a, b] is generalized Riemann integrable if and only if it
satisfies a two-sided boundedness condition.
We proved in Example 8.2.1(c) that if ð f k Þ is a sequence in R½a; b# that converges on
[a, b] to a function f 2 R½a; b#, then it need not happen that

However, in Theorem 8.2.4 we saw that uniform convergence of the sequence is sufficient
to guarantee that this equality holds. In fact, we will now show that this is even true for a
sequence of generalized Riemann integrable functions.

CHAPTER 10 THE GENERALIZED RIEMANN INTEGRAL

10.4.1 Uniform Convergence Theorem Let ð f k Þ be a sequence in R# ½a; b# and suppose
that ð f k Þ converges uniformly on [a, b] to f. Then f 2 R# ½a; b# and (1) holds.
Proof. Given e &gt; 0, there exists KðeÞ such that if k # KðeÞ and x 2 ½a; b#, then we have
j f k ðxÞ # f ðxÞj &lt; e. Consequently, if h; k # KðeÞ, then

Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, the sequence ð a f k Þ is a Cauchy sequence in R and therefore
converges to some number, say A 2 R. We will now show that f 2 R# ½a; b# with integral A.
For, if e &gt; 0 is given, let KðeÞ be as above. If P_ :¼ fð½xi#1 ; xi #; ti Þgni¼1 is any tagged

Q.E.D.
It will be seen in Example 10.4.6(a) that the conclusion of 10.4.1 is false for an infinite
interval.
Equi-integrability
The hypothesis of uniform convergence in Theorem 10.4.1 is a very stringent one and
restricts the utility of this result. Consequently, we now show that another type of
uniformity condition can be used to obtain the desired limit. This notion is due to Jaroslav
Kurzweil, as is Theorem 10.4.3.
10.4.2 Definition A sequence ð f k Þ in R# ðIÞ is said to be equi-integrable if for every

Q.E.D.
The Monotone and Dominated Convergence Theorems
Although the Equi-integrability Theorem is interesting, it is difficult to apply because it is
not easy to construct the gauges de . We now state two very important theorems summarizing the most important convergence theorems for the integral that are often useful. McLeod
[pp. 96–101] has shown that both of these theorems can be proved by using the Equiintegrability Theorem. However, those proofs require a delicate construction of the gauge
functions. Direct proofs of these results are given in [MTI], but these proofs also use results
not given here; therefore we will omit the proofs of these results.
We say that a sequence of functions on an interval I # R is monotone increasing if it
satisfies f 1 ðxÞ # f 2 ðxÞ # # # # # f k ðxÞ # f kþ1 ðxÞ # # # # for all k 2 N; x 2 I. It is said to be
monotone decreasing if it satisfies the opposite string of inequalities, and to be monotone
if it is either monotone increasing or decreasing.
10.4.4 Monotone Convergence Theorem Let ð f k Þ be a monotone sequence of func#
tions in R# ðIÞ such that f ðxÞ ¼ lim
#R f k ðxÞ

The next result is the most important theorem concerning the convergence of
integrable functions. It is an extension of the celebrated ‘‘Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem’’ from which it can also be proved.

R 1 Then the sequence converges uniformly on ð0; 1Þ to the 0-function. However,
0 f k ¼ 1 for all k 2 N, while the integral of the 0-function equals 0. It is an exercise
to show that the function supf f k ðxÞ : k 2 Ng does not belong to R# ½0; 1Þ, so the

Measurable Functions
We wish to characterize the collection of functions in R# ðIÞ. In order to bypass a few minor
details, we will limit our discussion to the case I :¼ [a, b]. We need to introduce the notion of a
‘‘measurable function’’; this class of functions contains all the functions the reader is ever
likely to encounter. Measurable functions are often defined in terms of the notion of a
‘‘measurable set.’’ However, the approach we will use is somewhat simpler and does not
require a theory of measurable sets to have been developed first. (In fact, the theory of
measure can be derived from properties of the integral; see Exercises 15 and 16.)
We recall from Definition 5.4.9 that a function s : ½a; b# ! R is a step function if it has
only a finite number of values, each value being assumed on a finite number of subintervals
of [a, b].
10.4.7 Definition A function f : ½a; b# ! R is said to be (Lebesgue) measurable if there
exists a sequence (sk) of step functions on [a, b] such that
ð13Þ

f ðxÞ ¼ lim sk ðxÞ
k!1

for almost every

x 2 ½a; b#:

We denote the collection of all measurable functions on [a, b] by M½a; b#.
Z
ð14Þ

We can reformulate the definition as: A function f is in M½a; b# if there exists a null set
[a, b] and a sequence (sk) of step functions such that
f ðxÞ ¼ lim sk ðxÞ
k!1

for all x 2 ½a; b#nZ:

It is trivial that every step function on [a, b] is a measurable function. By Theorem 5.4.10,
a continuous function on [a, b] is a uniform limit of a sequence of step functions; therefore,
every continuous function on an interval [a, b] is measurable. Similarly, every monotone
function on [a, b] is a uniform limit of step functions (see the proof of Theorem 7.2.8);
therefore, every monotone function on an interval is measurable.

At first glance, it might seem that the collection of measurable functions might not be
so very large. However, the requirement that the limit (13) is required to hold only almost
everywhere (and not everywhere), enables one to obtain much more general functions. We
now give a few examples.
10.4.8 Examples (a) The Dirichlet function, f (x) :¼ 1 for x 2 [0, 1] rational and
f (x) :¼ 0 for x 2 [0, 1] irrational, is a measurable function.
Since Q \ ½0; 1# is a null set, we can take each sk to be the 0-function. We then obtain
sk(x) ! f (x) for x 2 ½0; 1#nQ.
(b) Thomae’s function h (see Examples 5.1.6(h) and 7.1.7) is a measurable function.
Again, take sk to be the 0-function. Then sk(x) ! h(x) for x 2 ½0; 1#nQ.
(c) The function g(x) :¼ 1=x for x 2 (0, 1] and g(0) :¼ 0 is a measurable function.
This can be seen by taking a step function sk(x) :¼ 0 for x 2 [0,1=k) and (using 5.4.10)
such that jsk(x) # 1=xj &lt; 1=k for x 2 [1=k, 1]. Then sk(x) ! g(x) for all x 2 [0, 1].
(d) If f 2 M½a; b# and if c : ½a; b# ! R is such that cðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ a.e., then c 2 M½a; b#.
For, if f (x) ¼ lim sk(x) for x 2 [a, b]nZ1 and if c(x) ¼ f (x) for all x 2 [a, b]nZ2, then
c(x) ¼ lim sk(x) for all x 2 [a, b]n(Z1 [ Z2). Since Z1 [ Z2 is a null set when Z1 and Z2 are,
the conclusion follows.
&amp;
The next result shows that elementary combinations of measurable functions lead to
measurable functions.
10.4.9 Theorem Let f and g belong to M½a; b# and let c 2 R.
(a) Then the functions cf, j f j, f þ g, f # g, and f # g also belong to M½a; b#.
(b) If w : R ! R is continuous, then the composition w f 2 M½a; b#.
(c) If ( fn) is a sequence in M½a; b# and f (x) ¼ lim fn (x) almost everywhere on I, then
f 2 M½a; b#.
Proof. (a) We will prove that j f j is measurable. Let Z [a, b] be a null set such that (14)
holds. Since jskj is a step function, the Triangle Inequality implies that
0 # jj f ðxÞj # jsk ðxÞjj # j f ðxÞ # sk ðxÞj ! 0
for all x 2 [a, b]nZ. Therefore j f j 2 M½a; b#.
The other assertions in (a) follow from the basic properties of limits.
(b) If sk is a step function on [a, b], it is easily seen that w sk is also a step function on
[a, b]. Since w is continuous on R and f (x) ¼ lim sk(x) for all x 2 [a, b]nZ, it follows that
ðw f ÞðxÞ ¼ wð f ðxÞÞ ¼ lim wðsk ðxÞÞ ¼ limðw sk ÞðxÞ for all x 2 [a, b]nZ. Therefore w
f is measurable.
(c) This conclusion is not obvious; a proof is outlined in Exercise 14.
Q.E.D.
The next result is that we can replace the step functions in Definition 10.4.7 by
continuous functions. Since we will use only one part of this result, we content ourselves
with a sketch of the proof of the other part.

CHAPTER 10 THE GENERALIZED RIEMANN INTEGRAL

Proof. (() Let Z [a, b] be a null set and (gk) be a sequence of continuous functions
such that f (x) ¼ lim gk(x) for x 2 [a, b]nZ. Since gk is continuous, by 5.4.10 there exists a
step function sk such that
jgk ðxÞ # sk ðxÞj # 1=k

for all

x 2 ½a; b#:

Therefore we have
0 # j f ðxÞ # sk ðxÞj # j f ðxÞ # gk ðxÞj þ j gk ðxÞ # sk ðxÞj
# j f ðxÞ # gk ðxÞj þ 1=k;
whence it follows that f (x) ¼ lim gk(x) for all x 2 [a, b]nZ.
Sketch of ()) Let Z be a null set and (sk) be a sequence of step functions such that
f (x) ¼ lim sk(x) for all x 2 [a, b]nZ. Without loss of generality, we may assume that each
sk is continuous at the endpoints a, b. Since sk is discontinuous at only a finite number of
points in (a, b), which can be enclosed in a finite union Jk of intervals with total length #
1=k, we can construct a piecewise linear and continuous function gk that coincides with
sk on [a, b]nJk. It can be shown that gk(x) ! f (x) a.e. on I. (See [MTI] for the details.)
Q.E.D.

Functions in R# ½a; b# are Measurable
We now show that a generalized Riemann integrable function is measurable.
10.4.11 Measurability Theorem If f 2 R# ½a; b#, then f 2 M½a; b#.
Proof. Let F : ½a; b þ 1# ! R be the indefinite integral
Z
FðxÞ :¼

x

a

f

if

x 2 ½a; b#;

and let F(x) :¼ F(b) for x 2 (b, b þ 1]. It follows from the Fundamental Theorem
(Second Form) 10.1.11(a) that F is continuous on [a, b]. From 10.1.11(c), there exists a
null set Z such that the derivative F 0 (x) ¼ f (x) exists for x 2 [a, b]nZ. Therefore, if we
introduce the difference quotient functions
gk ðxÞ :¼

Fðx þ 1=kÞ # FðxÞ
1=k

for

x 2 ½a; bÞ; k 2 N;

then gk(x) ! f (x) for all x 2 [a, b]nZ. Since the gk are continuous, it follows from the part
of Theorem 10.4.10 we have proved that f 2 M½a; b#.
Q.E.D.

Are Measurable Functions Integrable?
Not every measurable function is generalized Riemann integrable. For example, the
function g(x) :¼ 1=x for x 2 (0,1] and g(0) :¼ 0 was seen in Example 10.4.8(c) to be
measurable; however, it is not in R# ½a; b# because it is ‘‘too large’’ (as x ! 0 þ). However,
if the graph of a measurable function on [a, b] lies between two functions in R# ½a; b#, then it
also belongs to R# ½a; b#.

(() Since f 2 M½a; b#, there exists a sequence (sk) of step functions on [a, b] such that
(13) holds. We define #sk :¼ midfa; sk ; vg for k 2 N, so that #sk ðxÞ is the middle of the
numbers a(x), sk(x), and v(x) for each x 2 [a, b]. It follows from Theorem 10.2.8 and the
facts
midfa; b; cg ¼ minfmaxfa; bg; maxfb; cg; maxfc; agg;
minfa0 ; b0 ; c0 g ¼ minfminfa0 ; b0 g; c0 g;
that #sk 2 R# ½a; b# and that a # #sk # v. Since f ¼ lim sk ¼ lim #sk a.e., the Dominated
Convergence Theorem now implies that f 2 R# ½a; b#.
If either a or v belongs to L½a; b#, then we can apply Theorem 10.2.6 to conclude that f
belongs to L½a; b#.
Q.E.D.
A Final Word
In this chapter we have made frequent reference to Lebesgue integrable functions on an interval
I, which we have introduced as functions in R# ðIÞ whose absolute value also belongs to R# ðIÞ.
While there is no single ‘‘standard approach’’ to the Lebesgue integral, our approach is very
different from any that are customary. A critic might say that our approach is not useful because
our definition of a function in LðIÞ is not standard, but that would be wrong.
After all, one seldom uses the definition to confirm that a specific function is Lebesgue
integrable. Instead, one uses the fact that certain simpler functions (such as step functions,
polynomials, continuous functions, bounded measurable functions) belong to LðIÞ, and
that more complicated functions belong to LðIÞ by taking algebraic combinations or
various limiting operations (e.g., Hake’s Theorem or the Dominated Convergence Theorem). A famous analyst once said, ‘‘No one ever calculates a Lebesgue integral; instead,
one calculates Riemann integrals and takes limits.’’
It is the same as with real numbers: we listed certain properties as axioms for R and
then derived consequences of these properties that enable us to work quite effectively with
the real numbers, often by taking limits.

CHAPTER 11

A GLIMPSE INTO TOPOLOGY

For the most part, we have considered only functions that were defined on intervals. Indeed,
for certain important results on continuous functions, the intervals were also assumed to be
closed and bounded. We shall now examine functions defined on more general types of
sets, with the goal of establishing certain important properties of continuous functions
in a more general setting. For example, we proved in Section 5.3 that a function that is
continuous on a closed and bounded interval attains a maximum value. However, we will
see that the hypothesis that the set is an interval is not essential, and in the proper context it
can be dropped.
In Section 11.1 we define the notions of an open set and a closed set. The study of open
sets and the concepts that can be defined in terms of open sets is the study of point-set
topology, so we are in fact discussing certain aspects of the topology of R. (The
mathematical area called ‘‘topology’’ is very abstract and goes far beyond the study of
the real line, but the key ideas are to be found in real analysis. In fact, it is the study of
continuous functions on R that motivated many of the concepts developed in topology.)
The notion of compact set is defined in Section 11.2 in terms of open coverings. In
advanced analysis, compactness is a powerful and widely used concept. The compact
subsets of R are fully characterized by the Heine-Borel Theorem, so the full strength of the
idea is not as apparent as it would be in more general settings. Nevertheless, as we establish
the basic properties of continuous functions on compact sets in Section 11.3, the reader
should begin to appreciate how compactness arguments are used.
In Section 11.4 we take the essential features of distance on the real line and introduce
a generalization of distance called a ‘‘metric.’’ The much-used triangle inequality is the key
property in this general concept of distance. We present examples and show how theorems
on the real line can be extended to the context of a metric space.
The ideas in this chapter are somewhat more abstract than those in earlier chapters;
however, abstraction can often lead to a deeper and more refined understanding. In this
case, it leads to a more general setting for the study of analysis.

Section 11.1 Open and Closed Sets in R
There are special types of sets that play a distinguished role in analysis—these are the open
and closed sets in R. To expedite the discussion, it is convenient to have an extended notion
of a neighborhood of a point.
11.1.1 Definition A neighborhood of a point x 2 R is any set V that contains an
e-neighborhood V e ðxÞ :¼ ðx # e; x þ eÞ of x for some e &gt; 0.
While an e-neighborhood of a point is required to be ‘‘symmetric about the point,’’ the
idea of a (general) neighborhood relaxes this particular feature, but often serves the same
purpose.

11.1 OPEN AND CLOSED SETS IN R

327

11.1.2 Definition (i) A subset G of R is open in R if for each x 2 G there exists a
neighborhood V of x such that V # G.
(ii) A subset F of R is closed in R if the complement CðF Þ :¼ RnF is open in R.
To show that a set G # R is open, it suffices to show that each point in G has an
e-neighborhood contained in G. In fact, G is open if and only if for each x 2 G, there exists
ex &gt; 0 such that ðx # ex ; x þ ex Þ is contained in G.
To show that a set F # R is closed, it suffices to show that each point y 2
= F has an
e-neighborhood disjoint from
F.
In
fact,
F
is
closed
if
and
only
if
for
each
y
2
= F there
#
#
exists ey &gt; 0 such that F \ y # ey ; y þ ey ¼ ;.
11.1.3 Examples (a) The entire set R ¼ ð#1; 1Þ is open.
For any x 2 R, we may take e :¼ 1.
(b) The set G :¼ fx 2 R : 0 &lt; x &lt; 1g is open.
For any x 2 G we may take ex to be the smaller of the numbers x; 1 # x. We leave it
to the reader to show that if ju # xj &lt; ex then u 2 G.
(c) Any open interval I :¼ ða; bÞ is an open set.
In fact, if x 2 I, we can take ex to be the smaller of the numbers x # a; b # x. The
reader can then show that ðx # ex ; x þ ex Þ # I. Similarly, the intervals ð#1; bÞ and ða; 1Þ
are open sets.
(d) The set I :¼ ½0; 1# is not open.
This follows since every neighborhood of 0 2 I contains points not in I.
(e) The set I :¼ ½0; 1# is closed.
To see this let y 2
= I; then either y &lt; 0 or y &gt; 1. If y &lt; 0, we take ey :¼ jyj, and if y &gt; 1
we #take ey :¼ y ## 1. We leave it to the reader to show that in either case we have
I \ y # ey ; y þ ey ¼ ;.
(f) The set H :¼ fx : 0 # x &lt; 1g is neither open nor closed. (Why?)
(g) The empty set ; is open in R.
In fact, the empty set contains no points at all, so the requirement in Definition 11.1.2(i) is
vacuously satisfied. The empty set is also closed since its complement R is open, as was seen in
&amp;
part (a).
In ordinary parlance, when applied to doors, windows, and minds, the words ‘‘open’’
and ‘‘closed’’ are antonyms. However, when applied to subsets of R, these words are not
antonyms. For example, we noted above that the sets ;, R are both open and closed in R.
(The reader will probably be relieved to learn that there are no other subsets of R that have
both properties.) In addition, there are many subsets of R that are neither open nor closed;
in fact, most subsets of R have this neutral character.
The following basic result describes the manner in which open sets relate to the
operations of the union and intersection of sets in R.
11.1.4 Open Set Properties (a) The union of an arbitrary collection of open subsets
in R is open.
(b) The intersection of any finite collection of open sets in R is open.
Proof. (a) Let fGl : l 2 Lg be a family of sets in R that are open, and let G be their
union. Consider an element x 2 G; by the definition of union, x must belong to Gl0 for


C11

CHAPTER 11 A GLIMPSE INTO TOPOLOGY

some l0 2 L. Since Gl0 is open, there exists a neighborhood V of x such that V # Gl0 .
But Gl0 # G, so that V # G. Since x is an arbitrary element of G, we conclude that G is
open in R.
(b) Suppose G1 and G2 are open and let G :¼ G1 \ G2 . To show that G is open,
we consider any x 2 G; then x 2 G1 and x 2 G2 . Since G1 is open, there exists e1 &gt; 0 such
that ðx # e1 ; x þ e1 Þ is contained in G1. Similarly, since G2 is open, there exists e2 &gt; 0
such thatðx # e2 ; x þ e2 Þ is contained in G2. If we now take e to be the smaller of e1 and e2,
then the e-neighborhood U :¼ ðx # e; x þ eÞ satisfies both U # G1 and U # G2 . Thus,
x 2 U # G. Since x is an arbitrary element of G, we conclude that G is open in R.
It now follows by an Induction argument (which we leave to the reader to write out)
that the intersection of any finite collection of open sets is open.
Q.E.D.
The corresponding properties for closed sets will be established by using the general
De Morgan identities for sets and their components. (See Theorem 1.1.4.)
11.1.5 Closed Set Properties (a) The intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed
sets in R is closed.
(b) The union of any finite collection of closed sets in R is closed.
T
Proof. (a) If fF l : l 2 Lg is a family of closed sets in R and F :¼
F l , then CðF Þ ¼
l2L
S
CðF l Þ is the union of open sets. Hence, CðF Þ is open by Theorem 11.1.4(a), and
l2L

consequently, F is closed.
(b) Suppose F 1 ; F 2 ; . . . ; F n are closed in R and let F :¼ F 1 [ F 2 [ # # # [ F n . By the
De Morgan identity the complement of F is given by
CðF Þ ¼ CðF 1 Þ \ # # # \ CðF n Þ:
Since each set CðF i Þ is open, it follows from Theorem 11.1.4(b) that CðF Þ is open. Hence F
is closed.
Q.E.D.
The finiteness restrictions in 11.1.4(b) and 11.1.5(b) cannot be removed. Consider the
following examples:
11.1.6 Examples (a) Let Gn :¼ ð0; 1 þ 1=nÞ for n 2 N. Then Gn is open for each
1
T
Gn is the interval (0, 1],
n 2 N, by Example 11.1.3(c). However, the intersection G :¼
n¼1

which is not open. Thus, the intersection of infinitely many open sets in R need not be open.
1
S
F n is the set
(b) Let F n :¼ ½1=n; 1# for n 2 N. Each Fn is closed, but the union F :¼
n¼1

(0, 1] which is not closed. Thus, the union of infinitely many closed sets in R need not be
&amp;
closed.
The Characterization of Closed Sets
We shall now give a characterization of closed subsets of R in terms of sequences. As we
shall see, closed sets are precisely those sets F that contain the limits of all convergent
sequences whose elements are taken from F.
11.1.7 Characterization of Closed Sets Let F # R; then the following assertions are
equivalent.

F is a closed subset of R.
If X ¼ ðxn Þ is any convergent sequence of elements in F, then lim X belongs to F.

Proof. (i) ) (ii) Let X ¼ ðxn Þ be a sequence of elements in F and let x :¼ lim X; we
wish to show that x 2 F. Suppose, on the contrary, that x 2
= F; that is, that x 2 CðF Þ the
complement of F. Since CðF Þ is open and x 2 CðF Þ, it follows that there exists an
e-neighborhood V e of x such that V e is contained in CðF Þ. Since x ¼ limðxn Þ, it follows that
there exists a natural number K ¼ K ðeÞ such that xK 2 V e . Therefore we must have
xK 2 CðF Þ; but this contradicts the assumption that xn 2 F for all n 2 N. Therefore, we
conclude that x 2 F.
(ii) ) (i) Suppose, on the contrary, that F is not closed, so that G :¼ CðF Þ is not open.
Then there exists a point y0 2 G such that for each n 2 N, there is a number yn 2 CðGÞ ¼ F
such that jyn # y0 j &lt; 1=n. It follows that y0 :¼ limðyn Þ, and since yn 2 F for all n 2 N, the
hypothesis (ii) implies that y0 2 F, contrary to the assumption y0 2 G ¼ CðF Þ. Thus the
hypothesis that F is not closed implies that (ii) is not true. Consequently (ii) implies (i), as
asserted.

Q.E.D.

The next result is closely related to the preceding theorem. It states that a set F is
closed if and only if it contains all of its cluster points. Recall from Section 4.1 that a point x
is a cluster point of a set F if every e-neighborhood of x contains a point of F different from
x. Since by Theorem 4.1.2 each cluster point of a set F is the limit of a sequence of points in
F, the result follows immediately from Theorem 11.1.7 above. We provide a second proof
that uses only the relevant definitions.
11.1.8 Theorem A subset of R is closed if and only if it contains all of its cluster points.
Proof. Let F be a closed set in R and let x be a cluster point of F; we will show that x 2 F.
If not, then x belongs to the open set CðF Þ. Therefore there exists an e-neighborhood V e of x
such that V e # CðF Þ. Consequently V e \ F ¼ ;, which contradicts the assumption that x is
a cluster point of F.
Conversely, let F be a subset of R that contains all of its cluster points; we will show
that CðF Þ is open. For if y 2 CðF Þ, then y is not a cluster point of F. It follows that there
exists an e-neighborhood V e of y that does not contain a point of F (except possibly y). But
since y 2 CðF Þ, it follows that V e # CðF Þ. Since y is an arbitrary element of CðF Þ, we
deduce that for every point in CðF Þ there is an e-neighborhood that is entirely contained in
CðF Þ. But this means that CðF Þ is open in R. Therefore F is closed in R.
Q.E.D.

The Characterization of Open Sets
The idea of an open set in R is a generalization of the notion of an open interval. That this
generalization does not lead to extremely exotic sets that are open is revealed by the next
result.
11.1.9 Theorem A subset of R is open if and only if it is the union of countably many
disjoint open intervals in R.
Proof. Suppose that G 6¼ ; is an open set in R. For each x 2 G, let Ax :¼ fa 2 R :
ða; x# # G} and let Bx :¼ fb 2 R : ½x; bÞ # Gg. Since G is open, it follows that Ax and Bx

are not empty. (Why?) If the set Ax is bounded below, we set ax :¼ inf Ax ; if Ax is not
bounded below, we set ax :¼ #1. Note that in either case ax 2
= G. If the set Bx is bounded
above, we set bx :¼ sup Bx ; if Bx is not bounded above, we set bx :¼ 1. Note that in either
case bx 2
= G.
We now define I x :¼ ðax ; bx Þ; clearly Ix is an open interval containing x. We claim
that I x # G. To see this, let y 2 I x and suppose that y &lt; x. It follows from the definition of
ax that there exists a0 2 Ax with a0 &lt; y, whence y 2 ða0 ; x# # G. Similarly, if y 2 I x and
x &lt; y, there exists b0 2 Bx with y &lt; b0 , whence it follows that y 2 ½x; b0 Þ # G. Since y 2 I x
is arbitrary, we have that I x # G.
S
Since x 2 G is arbitrary, we conclude that
I x # G. On the other hand, since for each
x2G
S
x 2 G there is an open interval Ix with x 2 I x # G, we also have G #
I x . Therefore we
x2G
S
conclude that G ¼
Ix.
x2G

We claim that if x; y 2 G and x 6¼ y, then either I x ¼ I y or I x \ I y ¼ ;. To prove this
suppose that z 2 I x \ I y , whence it follows that ax &lt; z &lt; by and ay &lt; z &lt; bx . (Why?) We
will show that ax ¼ ay . If not, it follows from the Trichotomy Property that either
(i) ax &lt; ay , or (ii) ay &lt; ax . In case (i), then ay 2 I x ¼ ð#ax ; bx Þ## G, which contradicts
the fact that ay 2
= G. Similarly, in case (ii), then ax 2 I y ¼ ay ; by # G, which contradicts
= G. Therefore we must have ax ¼ ay and a similar argument implies that
the fact that ax 2
bx ¼ by. Therefore, we conclude that if I x \ I y 6¼ ;, then Ix ¼ Iy.
It remains to show that the collection of distinct intervals fI x : x 2 Gg is countable. To
do this, we enumerate the set Q of rational numbers Q ¼ fr1 ; r2 ; . . . ; rn ; . . .g (see Theorem
1.3.11). It follows from the Density Theorem 2.4.8 that each interval Ix contains rational
numbers; we select the rational number in Ix that has the smallest index n in this enumeration
of Q . That is, we choose rnðxÞ 2 Q such that I rnðxÞ ¼ I x and n(x) is the smallest index n
such that I rn ¼ I x . Thus the set of distinct intervals I x ; x 2 G, is put into correspondence with
a subset of N. Hence this set of distinct intervals is countable.
Q.E.D.
It is left as an exercise to show that the representation of G as a disjoint union of open
intervals is uniquely determined.
It does not follow from the preceding theorem that a subset of R is closed if and only if
it is the intersection of a countable collection of closed intervals (why not?). In fact, there
are closed sets in R that cannot be expressed as the intersection of a countable collection of
closed intervals in R. A set consisting of two points is one example. (Why?) We will now
describe the construction of a much more interesting example called the Cantor set.
The Cantor Set
The Cantor set, which we will denote by F, is a very interesting example of a (somewhat
complicated) set that is unlike any set we have seen up to this point. It reveals how
inadequate our intuition can sometimes be in trying to picture subsets of R.
The Cantor set F can be described by removing a sequence of open#intervals
# from the
closed unit interval I :¼ ½0; 1#. We first remove the open middle third 13 ; 23 of [0, 1] to
obtain the set
h i h i
F 1 :¼ 0; 13 [ 23; 1 :
We next remove the open middle third of each of the two closed intervals in F1 to obtain
the set
h i h i h i h i
F 2 :¼ 0; 19 [ 29; 13 [ 23; 79 [ 89; 1 :

We
that F2 is# the union of 22 ¼ 4 closed intervals, each of which is of the form

k=3 ; ðk þ 1Þ=32 . We next remove the open middle thirds of each of these sets to get F3,
which is the union of 23 ¼ 8 closed intervals. We continue in this way. In general, if Fn has
been constructed and consists of the union of 2n intervals of the form ½k=3n ; ðk þ 1Þ=3n #,
then we obtain the set F nþ1 by removing the open middle third of each of these intervals.
The Cantor set F is what remains after this process has been carried out for every n 2 N.
(See Figure 11.1.1.)

Figure 11.1.1

Construction of the Cantor set

11.1.10 Definition The Cantor set F is the intersection of the sets F n ; n 2 N, obtained
by successive removal of open middle thirds, starting with [0, 1].
Since it is the intersection of closed sets, F is itself a closed set by 11.1.5(a). We now
list some of the properties of F that make it such an interesting set.
(1) The total length of the removed intervals is 1.
We note that the first middle third has length 1=3, the next two middle thirds have
lengths that add up to 2/32, the next four middle thirds have lengths that add up to 22=33,
and so on. The total length L of the removed intervals is given by
1 # #n
1 2
2n
1X
2
:
L ¼ þ 2 þ # # # þ nþ1 þ # # # ¼
3 3
3 n¼0 3

Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we obtain
L¼

1
1
#
¼ 1:
3 1 # ð2=3Þ

Thus F is a subset of the unit interval [0, 1] whose complement in [0, 1] has total length 1.
Note also that the total length of the intervals that make up Fn is (2/3)n, which has limit
0 as n ! 1. Since F # F n for all n 2 N, we see that if F can be said to have ‘‘length,’’ it
must have length 0.
(2) The set F contains no nonempty open interval as a subset.
Indeed, if F contains a nonempty open interval J :¼ ða; bÞ, then since J # F n for all
n 2 N, we must have 0 &lt; b # a # ð2=3Þn for all n 2 N. Therefore b # a ¼ 0, whence J is
empty, a contradiction.
(3) The Cantor set F has infinitely (even uncountably) many points.
The Cantor set contains all of the endpoints of the removed open intervals, and these
are all points of the form 2k/3n where k ¼ 0; 1; . . . ; n for each n 2 N. There are infinitely
many points of this form.
The Cantor set actually contains many more points than those of the form 2k=3n;
in fact, F is an uncountable set. We give an outline of the argument. We note that each

where each an is either 0 or 1 or 2. (See the discussion at the end of Section 2.5.) Indeed,
each x that lies
# in one
# of the removed open intervals has an ¼ 1 for some n; for example,
each point in 13 ; 23 has a1 ¼ 1. The endpoints of the removed intervals have two possible
ternary expansions, one having no 1s; for example, 3 ¼ ð:100 # # #Þ3 ¼ ð:022 # # #Þ3 . If we
choose the expansion without 1s for these points, then F consists of all x 2 ½0; 1# that have
ternary expansions with no 1s; that is, an is 0 or 2 for all n 2 N. We now define a mapping w
of F onto [0, 1] as follows:

denotes the binary representation of a number. Thus w is a surjection of F onto [0, 1].
Assuming that F is countable, Theorem 1.3.10 implies that there exists a surjection c of N
onto F, so that w # c is a surjection of N onto [0, 1]. Another application of Theorem
1.3.10 implies that [0, 1] is a countable set, which contradicts Theorem 2.5.5. Therefore F
is an uncountable set.

Section 11.2 Compact Sets
In advanced analysis and topology, the notion of a ‘‘compact’’ set is of enormous
importance. This is less true in R because the Heine-Borel Theorem gives a very simple
characterization of compact sets in R. Nevertheless, the definition and the techniques
used in connection with compactness are very important, and the real line provides an
appropriate place to see the idea of compactness for the first time.
The definition of compactness uses the notion of an open cover, which we now define.
11.2.1 Definition Let A be a subset of R. An open cover of A is a collection G ¼ fGa g of
open sets in R whose union contains A; that is,
[
A#
Ga :
a
0

If G is a subcollection of sets from G such that the union of the sets in G0 also contains A,
then G0 is called a subcover of G. If G0 consists of finitely many sets, then we call G0 a finite
subcover of G.
There can be many different open covers for a given set. For example, if A :¼ ½1; 1Þ,
then the reader can verify that the following collections of sets are all open covers of A:

CHAPTER 11 A GLIMPSE INTO TOPOLOGY

We note that G2 is a subcover of G1 , and that G4 is a subcover of G3 . Of course, many other
open covers of A can be described.
11.2.2 Definition A subset K of R is said to be compact if every open cover of K has a
finite subcover.
In other words, a set K is compact if, whenever it is contained in the union of a
collection G ¼ fGa g of open sets in R, then it is contained in the union of some finite
number of sets in G.
It is very important to note that, in order to apply the definition to prove that a set K is
compact, we must examine an arbitrary collection of open sets whose union contains K,
and show that K is contained in the union of some finite number of sets in the given
collection. That is, it must be shown that any open cover of K has a finite subcover. On the
other hand, to prove that a set H is not compact, it is sufficient to exhibit one specific
collection G of open sets whose union contains H, but such that the union of any finite
number of sets in G fails to contain H. That is, H is not compact if there exists some open
cover of H that has no finite subcover.
11.2.3 Examples (a) Let K :¼ fx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn g be a finite subset of R. If G ¼ fGa g is
an open cover of K, then each xi is contained in some set Gai in G. Then the union of the sets
in the collection fGa1 ; Ga2 ; . . . ; Gan g contains K, so that it is a finite subcover of G. Since G
was arbitrary, it follows that the finite set K is compact.
(b) Let H :¼ ½0; 1Þ. To prove that H is not compact, we will exhibit an open cover that
1
S
has no finite subcover. If we let Gn :¼ ð#1; nÞ for each n 2 N, then H #
Gn , so that
n¼1

G :¼ fGn : n 2 N g is an open cover of H. However, if fGn1 ; Gn2 ; . . . ; Gnk g is any finite
subcollection of G, and if we let m :¼ supfn1 ; n2 ; . . . ; nk g, then
Gn1 [ Gn2 [ # # # [ Gnk ¼ Gm ¼ ð#1; mÞ:
Evidently, this union fails to contain H ¼ ½0; 1Þ. Thus no finite subcollection of G will
have its union contain H, and therefore H is not compact.
(c) Let J :¼ ð0; 1Þ. If we let Gn :¼ ð1=n; 1Þ for each n 2 N, then it is readily seen that
1
S
J¼
Gn . Thus G :¼ fGn : n 2 N g is an open cover of J. If fGn1 ; Gn2 ; . . . ; Gnr g is any
n¼1

finite subcollection of G, and if we set s :¼ supfn1 ; n2 ; . . . ; nr g then
Gn1 [ Gn2 [ # # # [ Gnr ¼ Gs ¼ ð1=s; 1Þ:
Since 1=s is in J but not in Gs, we see that the union does not contain J. Therefore, J is
&amp;
not compact.
We now wish to describe all compact subsets of R. First we will establish by rather
straightforward arguments that any compact set in R must be both closed and bounded.
Then we will show that these properties in fact characterize the compact sets in R. This is
the content of the Heine-Borel Theorem.
11.2.4 Theorem If K is a compact subset of R, then K is closed and bounded.

11.2 COMPACT SETS

Proof. We will first show that K is bounded. For each m 2 N, let H m :¼ ð#m; mÞ. Since
1
S
each H m is open and since K #
H m ¼ R, we see that the collection fH m : m 2 N g is an
m¼1

open cover of K. Since K is compact, this collection has a finite subcover, so there exists
M 2 N such that
K#

M
[

H m ¼ H m ¼ ð#M; M Þ:

m¼1

Therefore K is bounded, since it is contained in the bounded interval ð#M; M Þ.
We now show that K is closed, by showing that its complement CðK Þ is open. To do so,
let u 2 CðK Þ be arbitrary and for each n 2 N, we let Gn :¼ fy 2 R : jy # uj &gt; 1=ng. It is an
1
S
Gn . Since u 2
= K, we have
exercise to show that each set Gn is open and that Rnfug ¼
K#

n¼1

Gn . Since K is compact, there exists m 2 N such that
K#

Gn ¼ Gm :

n¼1

Now it follows from this that K \ ðu # 1=m; u þ 1=mÞ ¼ ;, so that the interval ðu # 1=m;
u þ 1=m # CðK Þ. But since u was an arbitrary point in CðK Þ, we infer that CðK Þ
is open.
Q.E.D.
We now prove that the conditions of Theorem 11.2.4 are both necessary and sufficient
for a subset of R to be compact.
11.2.5 Heine-Borel Theorem A subset K of R is compact if and only if it is closed and
bounded.
Proof. We have shown in Theorem 11.2.4 that a compact set in R must be closed and
bounded. To establish the converse, suppose that K is closed and bounded, and let G ¼
fGa g be an open cover of K. We wish to show that K must be contained in the union of some
finite subcollection from G. The proof will be by contradiction. We assume that:
ð1Þ

K is not contained in the union of any finite number of sets in G:

By hypothesis, K is bounded, so there exists r &gt; 0 such that K # ½#r; r#. We let I 1 :¼
½#r; r# and bisect I1 into two closed subintervals I 01 :¼ ½#r; 0# and I 001 :¼ ½0; r#. At least one
of the two subsets K \ I 01 and K \ I 001 must be nonvoid and have the property that it is not
contained in the union of any finite number of sets in G. [For if both of the sets #K \ I 01 and
#
00
0
#K \ I 1 00are
# contained in the union of some finite number of sets in G, then K ¼ K \ I 1 [
K \ I 1 is contained in the union of some finite number of sets in G, contrary to the
assumption (1).] If K \ I 01 is not contained in the union of some finite number of sets in G,
we let I 2 :¼ I 01 ; otherwise K \ I 001 has this property and we let I 2 :¼ I 001 .
We now bisect I2 into two closed subintervals I 02 and I 002 . If K \ I 02 is nonvoid and is not
contained in the union of some finite number of sets in G, we let I 3 :¼ I 02 ; otherwise K \ I 002
has this property and we let I 3 :¼ I 002 .
Continuing this process, we obtain a nested sequence of intervals (In). By the Nested
Intervals Property 2.5.2, there is a point z that belongs to all of the I n ; n 2 N. Since each
interval In contains infinitely many points in K (why?), the point z is a cluster point of K.
Moreover, since K is assumed to be closed, it follows from Theorem 11.1.8 that z 2 K.

CHAPTER 11 A GLIMPSE INTO TOPOLOGY

Therefore there exists a set Gl in G with z 2 Gl . Since Gl is open, there exists e &gt; 0 such
that
ðz # e; z þ eÞ # Gl :
On the other hand, since the intervals In are obtained by repeated bisections of I 1 ¼ ½#r; r#,
the length of In is r=2n#2 . It follows that if n is so large that r=2n#2 &lt; e, then
I n # ðz # e; z þ eÞ # Gl . But this means that if n is such that r=2n#2 &lt; e, then K \ I n
is contained in the single set Gl in G, contrary to our construction of In. This contradiction
shows that the assumption (1) that the closed bounded set K requires an infinite number
of sets in G to cover it is untenable. We conclude that K is compact.
Q.E.D.
Remark It was seen in Example 11.2.3(b) that the closed set H :¼ ½0; 1Þ is not
compact; note that H is not bounded. It was also seen in Example 11.2.3(c) that the
bounded set J :¼ ð0; 1Þ is not compact; note that J is not closed. Thus, we cannot drop
either hypothesis of the Heine-Borel Theorem.
We can combine the Heine-Borel Theorem with the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
3.4.8 to obtain a sequential characterization of the compact subsets of R.
11.2.6 Theorem A subset K of R is compact if and only if every sequence in K has a
subsequence that converges to a point in K.
Proof. Suppose that K is compact and let (xn) be a sequence with xn 2 K for all n 2 N. By
the Heine-Borel Theorem, the set K is bounded so that the sequence (xn) is bounded; by the
Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem 3.4.8, there exists a subsequence ðxnk Þ that converges. Since
K is closed (by Theorem 11.2.4), the limit x :¼ limðxnk Þ is in K. Thus every sequence in K
has a subsequence that converges to a point of K.
To establish the converse, we will show that if K is either not closed or not bounded,
then there must exist a sequence in K that has no subsequence converging to a point of K.
First, if K is not closed, then there is a cluster point c of K that does not belong to K. Since c
is a cluster point of K, there is a sequence (xn) with xn 2 K and xn 6¼ c for all n 2 N such
that limðxn Þ ¼ c. Then every subsequence of (xn) also converges to c, and since c 2
= K,
there is no subsequence that converges to a point of K.
Second, if K is not bounded, then there exists a sequence (xn) in K such that jxn j &gt; n
for all n 2 N. (Why?) Then every subsequence of (xn) is unbounded, so that no subsequence
of it can converge to a point of K.
Q.E.D.
Remark The reader has probably noticed that there is a similarity between the compactness of the interval [a, b] and the existence of d-fine partitions for [a, b]. In fact, these
properties are equivalent, each being deducible from the other. However, compactness
applies to sets that are more general than intervals.

Section 11.3 Continuous Functions
In this section we will examine the way in which the concept of continuity of functions
can be related to the topological ideas of open sets and compact sets. Some of the
fundamental properties of continuous functions on intervals presented in Section 5.3
will be established in this context. Among other things, these new arguments will
show that the concept of continuity and many of its important properties can be
carried to a greater level of abstraction. This will be discussed briefly in the next
section on metric spaces.

Continuity
In Section 5.1 we were concerned with continuity at a point, that is, with the ‘‘local’’
continuity of functions. We will now be mainly concerned with ‘‘global’’ continuity in the
sense that we will assume that the functions are continuous on their entire domains.
The continuity of a function f : A ! R at a point c 2 A was defined in Section 5.1.
Theorem 5.1.2 stated that f is continuous at c if and only if for every e-neighbornood
V e ð f ðcÞÞ of f ðcÞ there exists a d-neighborhood V d ðcÞ of c such that if x 2 V d ðcÞ \ A, then
f ðxÞ 2 V e ð f ðcÞÞ. We wish to restate this condition for continuity at a point in terms of
general neighborhoods. (Recall from 11.1.1 that a neighborhood of a point c is any set U
that contains an e-neighborhood of c for some e &gt; 0.)

CHAPTER 11 A GLIMPSE INTO TOPOLOGY

11.3.1 Lemma A function f : A ! R is continuous at the point c in A if and only if for
every neighborhood U of f (c), there exists a neighborhood V of c such that if x 2 V \ A,
then f ðxÞ 2 U.
Proof. Suppose f satisfies the stated condition. Then given e &gt; 0, we let U ¼ V e ð f ðcÞÞ
and then obtain a neighborhood V for which x 2 V \ A implies f ðxÞ 2 U. If we choose
d &gt; 0 such that V d ðcÞ # V, then x 2 V d ðcÞ \ A implies f ðxÞ 2 U; therefore f is continuous
at c according to Theorem 5.1.2.
Conversely, if f is continuous at c in the sense of Theorem 5.1.2, then since any
neighborhood U of f ðcÞ contains an e-neighborhood V e ð f ðcÞÞ, it follows that taking the
d-neighborhood V ¼ V d ðcÞ of c of Theorem 5.1.2 satisfies the condition of the lemma.
Q.E.D.

We note that the statement that x 2 V \ A implies f ðxÞ 2 U is equivalent to the
statement that f ðV \ AÞ # U; that is, that the direct image of V \ A is contained in U. Also
from the definition of inverse image, this is the same as V \ A # f #1 ðU Þ. (See Definition
1.1.7 for the definitions of direct and inverse images.) Using this observation, we now
obtain a condition for a function to be continuous on its domain in terms of open sets. In
more advanced courses in topology, part (b) of the next result is often taken as the definition
of (global) continuity.
11.3.2 Global Continuity Theorem Let A # R and let f : A ! R be a function with
domain A. Then the following are equivalent:
(a) f is continuous at every point of A.
(b) For every open set G in R, there exists an open set H in R such that H \ A ¼ f #1 ðGÞ.
Proof. (a) ) (b). Assume that f is continuous at every point of A, and let G be a given
open set in R. If c belongs to f #1 ðGÞ, then f ðcÞ 2 G, and since G is open, G is a
neighborhood of f ðcÞ. Therefore, by the preceding lemma, it follows from the continuity of
f that there is an open set V ðcÞ such that x 2 V ðcÞ implies that f ðxÞ 2 G; that is, V ðcÞ is
contained in the inverse image f #1 ðGÞ. Select V ðcÞ for each c in f #1 ðGÞ, and let H be the
union of all these sets V ðcÞ. By the Open Set Properties 11.1.4, the set H is open, and we
have H \ A ¼ f #1 ðGÞ. Hence (a) implies (b).
(b) ) (a). Let c be any point A, and let G be an open neighborhood of f ðcÞ. Then
condition (b) implies that there exists an open set H in R such that H \ A ¼ f #1 ðGÞ. Since
f ðcÞ 2 G, it follows that c 2 H, so H is a neighborhood of c. If x 2 H \ A, then f ðcÞ 2 G,
and therefore f is continuous at c. Thus (b) implies (a).
Q.E.D.
In the case that A ¼ R, the preceding result simplifies to some extent.
11.3.3 Corollary A function f : R ! R is continuous if and only if f #1 ðGÞ is open in
R whenever G is open.
It must be emphasized that the Global Continuity Theorem 11.3.2 does not say that if f
is a continuous function, then the direct image f (G) of an open set is necessarily open. In
general, a continuous function will not send open sets to open sets. For example, consider
the continuous function f : R ! R defined by
f ðxÞ :¼ x2 þ 1 for

x 2 R:

If G is the open set G :¼ ð#1; 1Þ, then the direct image under f is f ðGÞ ¼ ½1; 2Þ, which is
not open in R. See the exercises for additional examples.
Preservation of Compactness
In Section 5.3 we proved that a continuous function takes a closed, bounded interval ½a; b#
onto a closed, bounded interval ½m; M #, where m and M are the minimum and maximum
values of f on ½a; b#, respectively. By the Heine-Borel Theorem, these are compact subsets
of R, so that Theorem 5.3.9 is a special case of the following theorem.
11.3.4 Preservation of Compactness If K is a compact subset of R and if f : K ! R is
continuous on K, then f (K) is compact.
Proof. Let G ¼ fGl g beSan open cover of the set f (K).
S We must show that G has a finite
subcover. Since f ðK Þ # Gl , it follows that K # f #1 ðGl Þ. By Theorem 11.3.2, for
each Gl there is an open set H l such that H l \ K ¼ f #1 ðGl Þ. Then the collection fH l g is
an open cover of the set K. Since K is compact, this open cover of K contains a finite
subcover fH l1 ; H l2 ; . . . ; H ln g. Then we have

f ðK Þ. Hence we have found a finite subcover of G. Since

G was an arbitrary open cover of f (K ), we conclude that f (K ) is compact.

Q.E.D.

11.3.5 Some Applications We will now show how to apply the notion of compactness
(and the Heine-Borel Theorem) to obtain alternative proofs of some important results that
we have proved earlier by using the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem. In fact, these theorems
remain true if the intervals are replaced by arbitrary nonempty compact sets in R.
(1) The Boundedness Theorem 5.3.2 is an immediate consequence of Theorem 11.3.4 and
the Heine-Borel Theorem 11.2.5. Indeed, if K # R is compact and if f : K ! R is
continuous on K, then f (K) is compact and hence bounded.
(2) The Maximum-Minimum Theorem 5.3.4 is also an easy consequence of Theorem
11.3.4 and the Heine-Borel Theorem. As before, we find that f ðK Þ is compact and hence
bounded in R, so that s :¼ sup f ðK Þ exists. If f ðK Þ is a finite set, then s 2 f ðK Þ. If f ðK Þ is
an infinite set, then s is a cluster point of f ðK Þ [see Exercise 11.2.6]. Since f ðK Þ is a closed
set, by the Heine-Borel Theorem, it follows from Theorem 11.1.8 that s 2 f ðK Þ. We
conclude that s ¼ f ðx Þ for some x 2 K.
(3) We can also give a proof of the Uniform Continuity Theorem 5.4.3 based on the notion
of compactness. To do so, let K # R be compact and let
#1 f : #K ! R be continuous on K.
Then given e &gt; 0 and u 2 K, there is a number du :¼ d 2 e; u &gt; 0 such that if x 2 K and
#
#
jx # uj &lt; du then j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj &lt; 12 e. For each u 2 K, let Gu :¼ u # 12 du ; u þ 12 du so that
Gu is open; we consider
the collection G ¼ fGu : u 2 K g. Since u 2 Gu for u 2 K, it is
S
trivial that K #
Gu . Since K is compact, there are a finite number of sets, say
u2K

Gu1 ; . . . ; GuM , whose union contains K. We now define
dðeÞ :¼ 12 inf fdu1 ; . . . ; duM g;

so that dðeÞ &gt; 0. Now if x; u 2 K and jx # uj &lt; dðeÞ, then there exists some uk with
k ¼ 1; . . . ; M such that x 2 Guk ; therefore jx # uk j &lt; 12 duk . Since we have dðeÞ # 12 duk , it
follows that
ju # uk j # ju # xj þ jx # uk j &lt; duk :
#
#
But since duk ¼ d 12 e; uk it follows that both
j f ðxÞ # f ðuk Þj &lt; 12 e

and

j f ðuÞ # f ðuk Þj &lt; 12 e:

Therefore we have j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj &lt; e.
We have shown that if e &gt; 0, then there exists dðeÞ &gt; 0 such that if x; u are any points
in K with jx # uj &lt; dðeÞ, then j f ðxÞ # f ðuÞj &lt; e. Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, this shows that f
&amp;
is uniformly continuous on K, as asserted.
We conclude this section by extending the Continuous Inverse Theorem 5.6.5 to
functions whose domains are compact subsets of R, rather than intervals in R.
11.3.6 Theorem If K is a compact subset of R and f : K ! R is injective and
continuous, then f #1 is continuous on f (K).
Proof. Since K is compact, then Theorem 11.3.4 implies that the image f (K) is compact.
Since f is injective by hypothesis, the inverse function f #1 is defined on f ðK Þ to K. Let ðyn Þ
be any convergent sequence in f ðK Þ, #and let y#0 ¼ limðyn Þ. To establish the continuity of
f #1 , we will show that the sequence f #1 ðyn Þ converges to f #1 ðy0 Þ.
Let xn :¼ f #1 ðyn Þ and, by way of contradiction, assume that ðxn Þ does not
# converge
# to
x0 :¼ f #1 ðy0 Þ. Then there exists an e &gt; 0 and a subsequence ðxk0 Þ such that #x0k # x0 # # e
#for00all
# k. Since K is compact,
# # we conclude from Theorem 11.2.6 that there is a subsequence
xr of the sequence x0k that converges to a point x #of#K. #Since
jx # x0 j # e, we have
#
00
x 6¼ x0 . Now
since

have

subsequence y00n of ðyn Þ that corresponds to the subsequence x00n of ðxn Þ must converge
to the same limit as ðyn Þ does, we have
# # ##
# #
lim f x00r ¼ lim y00n ¼ y0 ¼ f ðx0 Þ:
Therefore we conclude that f ðx Þ ¼ f ðx0 Þ. However, since f is injective, this implies that
x ¼ x0 , which is a contradiction. Thus we conclude that f #1 takes convergent sequences
in f ðK Þ to convergent sequences in K, and hence f #1 is continuous.

Section 11.4 Metric Spaces
This book has been devoted to a careful study of the real number system and a number of
different limiting processes that can be defined for functions of a real variable. A central
topic was the study of continuous functions. At this point, with a strong understanding of
analysis on the real line, the study of more general spaces and the related limit concepts can
begin. It is possible to generalize the fundamental concepts of real analysis in several
different ways, but one of the most fruitful is in the context of metric spaces, where a metric
is an abstraction of a distance function.
In this section, we will introduce the idea of metric space and then indicate how certain
areas of the theory developed in this book can be extended to this new setting. We will
discuss the concepts of neighborhood of a point, open and closed sets, convergence of
sequences, and continuity of functions defined on metric spaces. Our purpose in this brief
discussion is not to develop the theory of metric spaces to any great extent, but to reveal
how the key ideas and techniques of real analysis can be put into a more abstract and
general framework. The reader should note how the basic results of analysis on the real line
serve to motivate and guide the study of analysis in more general contexts.
Generalization can serve two important purposes. One purpose is that theorems
derived in general settings can often be applied in many particular cases without the need of
a separate proof for each special case. A second purpose is that by removing the
nonessential (and sometimes distracting) features of special situations, it is often possible
to understand the real significance of a concept or theorem.

Metrics
On the real line, basic limit concepts were defined in terms of the distance jx # yj
between two points x, y in R, and many theorems were proved using the absolute value
function. Actually, a careful study reveals that only a few key properties of the absolute
value were required to prove many fundamental results, and it happens that these
properties can be extracted and used to define more general distance functions called
‘‘metrics.’’

11.4.1 Definition A metric on a set S is a function d : S
following properties:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

S ! R that satisfies the

d ðx; yÞ # 0 for all x; y 2 S ðpositivityÞ;
d ðx; yÞ ¼ 0 if and only if x ¼ y ðdef initenessÞ;
d ðx; yÞ ¼ d ðy; xÞ for all x; y 2 S ðsymmetryÞ;
d ðx; yÞ # d ðx; zÞ þ d ðz; yÞ for all x; y; z 2 S ðtriangle inequalityÞ:

A metric space ðS; d Þ is a set S together with a metric d on S.
We consider several examples of metric spaces.
11.4.2 Examples (a) The familiar metric on R is defined by
d ðx; yÞ :¼ jx # yj

for

x; y 2 R:

Property 11.4.1(d) for d follows from the Triangle Inequality for absolute value because
we have
d ðx; yÞ ¼ jx # yj ¼ jðx # zÞ þ ðz # yÞj
# jx # zj þ jz # yj ¼ d ðx; zÞ þ d ðz; yÞ;
for all x; y; z 2 R.
(b) The distance function in the plane obtained from the Pythagorean Theorem provides
one example of a metric in R 2 . That is, we define the metric d on R 2 as follows: if
P1 :¼ ðx1 ; y1 Þ and P2 :¼ ðx2 ; y2 Þ are points in R 2 , then
qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
d ðP1 ; P2 Þ :¼ ðx1 # x2 Þ2 þ ðy1 # y2 Þ2 :
(c) It is possible to define several different metrics on the same set. On R 2 , we can also
define the metric d 1 as follows:
d 1 ðP1 ; P2 Þ :¼ jx1 # x2 j þ jy1 # y2 j:
Still another metric on R 2 is d 1 defined by
d 1 ðP1 ; P2 Þ :¼ sup fjx1 # x2 j; jy1 # y2 jg:
The verifications that d 1 and d 1 satisfy the properties of a metric are left as exercises.
(d) Let C½0; 1# denote the set of all continuous functions on the interval [0, 1] to R. For f ; g
in C½0; 1#, we define
d 1 ð f ; gÞ :¼ sup fj f ðxÞ # gðxÞj : x 2 ½0; 1#g:
Then it can be verified that d 1 is a metric on C ½0; 1#. This metric is the uniform norm of
f # g on [0, 1] as defined in Section 8.1; that is, d 1 ðf ; gÞ ¼ jj f # gjj, where jj f jj denotes
the uniform norm of f on the set [0, 1].
(e) We again consider C½0; 1#, but we now define a different metric d1 by
Z 1
for f; g 2 C ½0; 1#:
d 1 ð f ; gÞ :¼
j f # gj
0

The properties of the integral can be used to show that this is indeed a metric on C½0; 1#. The
details are left as an exercise.

(f) Let S be any nonempty set. For s; t 2 S, we define
d ðs; tÞ :¼

0
1

if
if

s ¼ t;
s 6¼ t:

It is an exercise to show that d is a metric on S. This metric is called the discrete metric
&amp;
on the set S.
We note that if ðS; d Þ is a metric space, and if T # S, then d 0 defined by d 0 ðx; yÞ :¼
d ðx; yÞ for all x; y 2 T gives a metric on T, which we generally denote by d. With this
understanding, we say that ðT; d Þ is also a metric space. For example, the metric d on R
defined by the absolute value is a metric on the set Q of rational numbers, and thus ðQ ; d Þ is
also a metric space.
Neighborhoods and Convergence
The basic notion needed for the introduction of limit concepts is that of neighborhood, and
this is defined in metric spaces as follows.
11.4.3 Definition Let (S, d) be a metric space. Then for e &gt; 0, the e-neighborhood of a
point x0 in S is the set
V e ðx0 Þ :¼ fx 2 S : d ðx0 ; xÞ &lt; eg:
A neighborhood of x0 is any set U that contains an e-neighborhood of x0 for some e &gt; 0.
Any notion defined in terms of neighborhoods can now be defined and discussed in the
context of metric spaces by modifying the language appropriately. We first consider the
convergence of sequences.
A sequence in a metric space ðS; d Þ is a function X : N ! S with domain N and range
in S, and the usual notations for sequence are used; we write X ¼ ðxn Þ, but now xn 2 S for
all n 2 N. When we replace the absolute value by a metric in the definition of sequential
convergence, we get the notion of convergence in a metric space.
11.4.4 Definition Let (xn) be a sequence in the metric space ðS; d Þ. The sequence (xn) is
said to converge to x in S if for any e &gt; 0 there exists K 2 N such that xn 2 V e ðxÞ for all
n # K.
Note that since xn 2 V e ðxÞ if and only if d ðxn ; xÞ &lt; e, a sequence ðxn Þ converges to x
if and only if for any e &gt; 0 there exists K such that d ðxn ; xÞ &lt; e for all n # K. In other
words, a sequence ðxn Þ in ðS; d Þ converges to x if and only if the sequence of real numbers
ðd ðxn ; xÞÞ converges to 0.
11.4.5 Examples (a) Consider R 2 with the metric d defined in Example 11.4.2(b). If
Pn ¼ ðxn ; yn Þ 2 R 2 for each n 2 N, then we claim that the sequence (Pn) converges to
P ¼ ðx; yÞ with respect to this metric if and only if the sequences of real numbers (xn) and
(yn) converge to x and y, respectively.
First, we note that the inequality jxn # xj # d ðPn ; PÞ implies that if (Pn) converges to
P with respect to the metric d, then the sequence (xn) converges to x; the convergence of
(yn) follows in a similar way. The converse follows from the inequality d ðPn ; PÞ #
jxn # xj þ jyn # yj, which is readily verified. The details are left to the reader.

CHAPTER 11 A GLIMPSE INTO TOPOLOGY

(b) Let d 1 be the metric on C[0, 1] defined in Example 11.4.2(d). Then a sequence ð f n Þ
in C[0, 1] converges to f with respect to this metric if and only if ð f n Þ converges to f
uniformly on the set [0, 1], This is established in Lemma 8.1.8 in the discussion of the
&amp;
uniform norm.

Cauchy Sequences
The notion of Cauchy sequence is a significant concept in metric spaces. The definition is
formulated as expected, with the metric replacing the absolute value.
11.4.6 Definition Let (S, d ) be a metric space. A sequence (xn) in S is said to be a
Cauchy sequence if for each e &gt; 0, there exists H 2 N such that d ðxn ; xm Þ &lt; e for all
n; m # H.
The Cauchy Convergence Theorem 3.5.5 for sequences in R states that a sequence in
R is a Cauchy sequence if and only if it converges to a point of R. This theorem is not true
for metric spaces in general, as the examples that follow will reveal. Those metric spaces
for which Cauchy sequences are convergent have special importance.
11.4.7 Definition A metric space (S, d ) is said to be complete if each Cauchy sequence
in S converges to a point of S.
In Section 2.3 the Completeness Property of R is stated in terms of the order properties
by requiring that every nonempty subset of R that is bounded above has a supremum in R.
The convergence of Cauchy sequences is deduced as a theorem. In fact, it is possible to
reverse the roles of these fundamental properties of R: the Completeness Property of R can
be stated in terms of Cauchy sequences as in 11.4.7, and the Supremum Property can then
be deduced as a theorem. Since many metric spaces do not have an appropriate order
structure, a concept of completeness must be described in terms of the metric, and Cauchy
sequences provide the natural vehicle for this.
11.4.8 Examples (a) The metric space ðQ ; d Þ of rational numbers with the metric
defined by the absolute value function is not complete.
pﬃﬃﬃ
For example, if (xn) is a sequence of rational numbers that converges to 2, then it is
Cauchy in Q , but it does not converge to a point of Q . Therefore ðQ ; d Þ is not a complete
metric space.
(b) The space C[0, 1] with the metric d 1 defined in 11.4.2(d) is complete.
To prove this, suppose that ( fn) is a Cauchy sequence in C[0, 1] with respect to the
metric d 1 . Then, given e &gt; 0, there exists H such that
ð1Þ

j f n ðxÞ # f m ðxÞj &lt; e

for all x 2 ½0; 1# and all n; m # H. Thus for each x, the sequence ð f n ðxÞÞ is Cauchy in R,
and therefore converges in R. We define f to be the pointwise limit of the sequence; that is,
f ðxÞ :¼ limð f n ðxÞÞ for each x 2 ½0; 1#. It follows from (1) that for each x 2 ½0; 1# and each
n # H, we have j f n ðxÞ # f ðxÞj # e. Consequently the sequence ð f n Þ converges uniformly
to f on [0, 1]. Since the uniform limit of continuous functions is also continuous (by 8.2.2),
the function f is in C ½0; 1#. Therefore the metric space ðC½0; 1#; d 1 Þ is complete.
(c) If d1 is the metric on C[0, 1] defined in 11.4.2(e), then the metric space ðC ½0; 1#; d 1 Þ is
not complete.

To prove this statement, it suffices to exhibit a Cauchy sequence that does not have a
limit in the space. We define the sequence ( fn) for n # 3 as follows (see Figure 11.4.1):

for 0 # x # 1=2;
&gt;
&lt;1
f n ðxÞ :¼ 1 þ n=2 # nx
for 1=2 &lt; x # 1=2 þ 1=n;
&gt;
:
0
for 1=2 þ 1=n &lt; x # 1:
Note that the sequence ( fn) converges pointwise to the discontinuous function f ðxÞ :¼ 1 for
0 # x # 1=2 and f ðxÞ :¼ 0 for 1=2 &lt; x # 1. Hence f 2
= C ½0; 1#; in fact, there is no

function g 2 C½0; 1# such that d 1 ð f n ; gÞ ! 0.

Open Sets and Continuity
With the notion of neighborhood defined, the definitions of open set and closed set read the
same as for sets in R.
11.4.9 Definition Let (S, d ) be a metric space. A subset G of S is said to be an open set in
S if for every point x 2 S there is a neighborhood U of x such that U # G. A subset F of S is
said to be a closed set in S if the complement SnF is an open set in S.
Theorems 11.1.4 and 11.1.5 concerning the unions and intersections of open sets and
closed sets can be extended to metric spaces without difficulty. In fact, the proofs of those
theorems carry over to metric spaces with very little change: simply replace the
e-neighborhoods ðx # e; x þ eÞ in R by e-neighborhoods V e ðxÞ in S.
We now can examine the concept of continuity for functions that map one metric space
(S1, d1) into another metric space (S2, d2). Note that we modify the property in 5.1.2 of
continuity for functions on R by replacing neighborhoods in R by neighborhoods in the
metric spaces.
11.4.10 Definition Let (S1, d1) and (S2, d2) be metric spaces, and let f : S1 ! S2 be a
function from S1 to S2. The function f is said to be continuous at the point c in S1 if for
every e-neighborhood V e ð f ðcÞÞ of f ðcÞ there exists a d-neighborhood V d ðcÞ of c such that if
x 2 V d ðcÞ, then f ðxÞ 2 V e ð f ðcÞÞ:
The e-d formulation of continuity can be stated as follows: f : S1 ! S2 is continuous at
c if and only if for each e &gt; 0 there exists d &gt; 0 such that d 1 ðx; cÞ &lt; d implies that
d 2 ð f ðxÞ; f ðcÞÞ &lt; e.

CHAPTER 11 A GLIMPSE INTO TOPOLOGY

The Global Continuity Theorem can be established for metric spaces by appropriately
modifying the argument for functions on R.
11.4.11 Global Continuity Theorem If (S1, d1) and (S2, d2) are metric spaces, then a
function f : S1 ! S2 is continuous on S1 if and only if f #1 ðGÞ is open in S1 whenever G is
open in S2.
The notion of compactness extends immediately to metric spaces. A metric space
(S, d ) is said to be compact if each open cover of S has a finite subcover. Then by
modifying the proof of 11.3.4, we obtain the following result.
11.4.12 Preservation of Compactness If (S, d ) is a compact metric space and if the
function f : S ! R is continuous, then f (S) is compact in R.
The important properties of continuous functions given in 11.3.5 then follow immediately. The Boundedness Theorem, the Maximum-Minimum Theorem, and the Uniform
Continuity Theorem for real-valued continuous functions on a compact metric space are all
established by appropriately modifying the language of the proofs given in 11.3.5.
Semimetrics
11.4.13 Definition A semimetric on a set S is a function d : S S ! R that satisfies all
of the conditions in Definition 11.4.1, except that condition (b) is replaced by the weaker
condition
(b0 )

d ðx; yÞ ¼ 0

if

x ¼ y:

A semimetric space (S, d ) is a set S together with a semimetric d on S.
Thus every metric is a semimetric, and every metric space is a semimetric space.
However, the converse is not true. For example, if P1 :¼ ðx1 ; y1 Þ and P2 :¼ ðx2 ; y2 Þ are
points in the space R 2 , the function d1 defined by
d 1 ðP1 ; P2 Þ :¼ jx1 # x2 j;
is easily seen to be a semimetric, but it is not a metric since any two points with the same
first coordinate have ‘‘d1-distance’’ equal to 0.
Somewhat more interestingly, if f, g are any functions in L½a; b#, we have defined (in
Definition 10.2.9) the distance function:
Z
distð f ; gÞ :¼

b
a

j f # gj:

Here it is clear that any two functions that are equal except at a countable set of points will
have distance equal to 0 from each other (in fact, this is also true when the functions are
equal almost everywhere).
The reader can retrace the discussion in the present section and see that most of what
we have done remains true for semimetrics and semimetric spaces. The main difference is
that a sequence in a semimetric space does not necessarily converge to a unique limit.
While this seems to be rather unusual, it is actually not a very serious problem and one can
learn to adjust to this situation. The other alternative is to ‘‘identify’’ points that have


C11

15:35:40

Page 347

11.4 METRIC SPACES

347

distance 0 from each other. This identification procedure is often invoked, but it means one
is dealing with ‘‘equivalence classes’’ rather than individual points. Often this cure is worse
than the malady.

APPENDIX A

LOGIC AND PROOFS

Natural science is concerned with collecting facts and organizing these facts into a
coherent body of knowledge so that one can understand nature. Originally much of
science was concerned with observation, the collection of information, and its classification. This classification gradually led to the formation of various ‘‘theories’’ that helped the
investigators to remember the individual facts and to be able to explain and sometimes
predict natural phenomena. The ultimate aim of most scientists is to be able to organize
their science into a coherent collection of general principles and theories so that these principles will enable them both to understand nature and to make predictions of the outcome
of future experiments. Thus they want to be able to develop a system of general principles
(or axioms) for their science that will enable them to deduce the individual facts and
consequences from these general laws.
Mathematics is different from the other sciences; by its very nature, it is a deductive
science. That is not to say that mathematicians do not collect facts and make observations
concerning their investigations. In fact, many mathematicians spend a large amount of time
performing calculations of special instances of the phenomena they are studying in the
hopes that they will discover ‘‘unifying principles.’’ (The great Gauss did a vast amount of
calculation and studied much numerical data before he was able to formulate a conjecture
concerning the distribution of prime numbers.) However, even after these principles and
conjectures are formulated, the work is far from over, for mathematicians are not satisfied
until conjectures have been derived (i.e., proved) from the axioms of mathematics, from the
definitions of the terms, and from results (or theorems) that have previously been proved.
Thus, a mathematical statement is not a theorem until it has been carefully derived from
axioms, definitions, and previously proved theorems.
A few words about the axioms (i.e., postulates, assumptions, etc.) of mathematics are
in order. There are a few axioms that apply to all of mathematics—the ‘‘axioms of set
theory’’—and there are specific axioms within different areas of mathematics. Sometimes
these axioms are stated formally, and sometimes they are built into definitions. For
example, we list properties in Chapter 2 that we assume the real number system possesses;
they are really a set of axioms. As another example, the definition of a ‘‘group’’ in abstract
algebra is basically a set of axioms that we assume a set of elements to possess, and the
study of group theory is an investigation of the consequences of these axioms.
Students studying real analysis for the first time usually do not have much experience
in understanding (not to mention constructing) proofs. In fact, one of the main purposes of
this course (and this book) is to help the reader gain experience in the type of critical
thought that is used in this deductive process. The purpose of this appendix is to help the
reader gain insight about the techniques of proof.
Statements and Their Combinations
All mathematical proofs and arguments are based on statements, which are declarative
sentences or meaningful strings of symbols that can be classified as being true or false. It is
348

not necessary that we know whether a given statement is actually true or false, but it must
be one or the other, and it cannot be both. (This is the Principle of the Excluded Middle.)
For example, the sentence ‘‘Chickens are pretty’’ is a matter of opinion and not a statement
in the sense of logic. Consider the following sentences:
#

It rained in Kuala Lumpur on June 2, 1988.
Thomas Jefferson was shorter than John Adams.
# There are infinitely many twin primes.
# This sentence is false.
#

The first three are statements: the first is true, the second is false, and the third is either true
or false, but we are not sure which at this time. The fourth sentence is not a statement; it can
be neither true nor false since it leads to contradictory conclusions.
Some statements (such as ‘‘1 þ 1 ¼ 2’’) are always true; they are called tautologies.
Some statements (such as ‘‘2 ¼ 3’’) are always false; they are called contradictions or
falsities. Some statements (such as ‘‘x2 ¼ 1’’) are sometimes true and sometimes false
(e.g., true when x ¼ 1 and false when x ¼ 3). Or course, for the statement to be completely
clear, it is necessary that the proper context has been established and the meaning of the
symbols has been properly defined (e.g., we need to know that we are referring to integer
arithmetic in the preceding examples).
Two statements P and Q are said to be logically equivalent if P is true exactly when Q
is true (and hence P is false exactly when Q is false). In this case we often write P # Q. For
example, we write
ðx is Abraham LincolnÞ # ðx is the 16th president of the United StatesÞ:
There are several different ways of forming new statements from given ones by using
logical connectives.
If P is a statement, then its negation is the statement denoted by
not P;
which is true when P is false, and is false when P is true. (A common notation for the
negation of P is : P.) A little thought shows that
P # notðnot PÞ:
This is the Principle of Double Negation.
If P and Q are statements, then their conjunction is the statement denoted by
P and Q;
which is true when both P and Q are true, and is false otherwise. (A standard notation for
the conjunction of P and Q is P ^ Q.) It is evident that
ðP and QÞ # ðQ and PÞ:
Similarly, the disjunction of P and Q is the statement denoted by
P or Q
which is true when at least one of P and Q is true, and false only when they are both false. In
legal documents ‘‘or’’ is often denoted by ‘‘and/or’’ to make it clear that this disjunction is
also true when both P and Q are true. (A standard notation for the disjunction of P and Q is
P _ Q.) It is also evident that
ðP or QÞ # ðQ or PÞ:

pnote
ﬃﬃﬃ that the statementp‘‘2
ﬃﬃﬃ &lt; 2 and
2 &lt; 3’’ is false, but the statement ‘‘2 &lt; 2 or 2 &lt; 3’’ is true (since 2 is approximately equal to 1.4142 . . . ).
Some thought shows that negation, conjunction, and disjunction are related by
De Morgan’s Laws:
not ðP and QÞ # ðnot PÞ or ðnot QÞ;
not ðP or QÞ # ðnot PÞ and ðnot QÞ:
The first of these equivalencies can be illustrated by considering the statements
P : x ¼ 2;

Q : y 2 A:

The statement (P and Q) is true when both (x ¼ 2) and (y 2 A) are true, and it is false when
at least one of (x ¼ 2) and (y 2 A) is false; that is, the statement not(P and Q) is true when at
least one of the statements (x 6¼ 2) and (y 2
= A) holds.
Implications
A very important way of forming a new statement from given ones is the implication (or
conditional) statement, denoted by
ðP ) QÞ;

ðif P then QÞ;

or

ðP implies QÞ:

Here P is called the hypothesis, and Q is called the conclusion of the implication. To help
understand the truth values of the implication, consider the statement
If I win the lottery today; then I’ll buy Sam a car:
Clearly this statement is false if I win the lottery and don’t buy Sam a car. What if I don’t
win the lottery today? Under this circumstance, I haven’t made any promise about buying
anyone a car, and since the condition of winning the lottery did not materialize, my failing
to buy Sam a car should not be considered as breaking a promise. Thus the implication is
regarded as true when the hypothesis is not satisfied.
In mathematical arguments, we are very much interested in implications when the
hypothesis is true, but not much interested in them when the hypothesis is false. The
accepted procedure is to take the statement P ) Q to be false only when P is true and Q is
false; in all other cases the statement P ) Q is true. (Consequently, if P is false, then we
agree to take the statement P ) Q to be true whether or not Q is true or false. That may
seem strange to the reader, but it turns out to be convenient in practice and consistent with
the other rules of logic.)
We observe that the definition of P ) Q is logically equivalent to
not ðP and ðnot QÞÞ;
because this statement is false only when P is true and Q is false, and it is true in all other
cases. It also follows from the first De Morgan Law and the Principle of Double Negation
that P ) Q is logically equivalent to the statement
ðnot PÞ or Q;
since this statement is true unless both (not P) and Q are false; that is, unless P is true and Q
is false.

APPENDIX A LOGIC AND PROOFS

Contrapositive and Converse
As an exercise, the reader should show that the implication P ) Q is logically equivalent to
the implication
ðnot QÞ ) ðnot PÞ;
which is called the contrapositive of the implication P ) Q. For example, if P ) Q is the
implication
If I am in Chicago; then I am in Illinois;
then the contrapositive (not Q) ) (not P) is the implication
If I am not in Illinois; then I am not in Chicago:
The equivalence of these two statements is apparent after a bit of thought. In attempting to
establish an implication, it is sometimes easier to establish the contrapositive, which is
logically equivalent to it. (This will be discussed in more detail later.)
If an implication P ) Q is given, then one can also form the statement
Q ) P;
which is called the converse of P ) Q. The reader must guard against confusing the
converse of an implication with its contrapositive, since they are quite different statements.
While the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the given implication, the converse is
not. For example, the converse of the statement
If I am in Chicago; then I am in Illinois;
is the statement
If I am in Illinois; then I am in Chicago:
Since it is possible to be in Illinois but not in Chicago, these two statements are evidently
not logically equivalent.
There is one final way of forming statements that we will mention. It is the double
implication (or the biconditional) statement, which is denoted by
P()Q

or

P if and only if Q;

and which is defined by
ðP ) QÞ and ðQ ) PÞ:
It is a straightforward exercise to show that P () Q is true precisely when P and Q are
both true, or both false.
Context and Quantifiers
In any form of communication, it is important that the individuals have an appropriate
context in mind. Statements such as ‘‘I saw Mary today’’ may not be particularly
informative if the hearer knows several persons named Mary. Similarly, if one goes
into the middle of a mathematical lecture and sees the equation x2 ¼ 1 on the blackboard, it
is useful for the viewer to know what the writer means by the letter x and the symbol 1. Is x
an integer? A function? A matrix? A subgroup of a given group? Does 1 denote a natural
number? The identity function? The identity matrix? The trivial subgroup of a group?
Often the context is well understood by the conversants, but it is always a good idea to
establish it at the start of a discussion. For example, many mathematical statements involve


BAPP01

12/08/2010

352

15:56:19

Page 352

APPENDIX A LOGIC AND PROOFS

one or more variables whose values usually affect the truth or the falsity of the statement, so
we should always make clear what the possible values of the variables are.
Very often mathematical statements involve expressions such as ‘‘for all,’’ ‘‘for every,’’
‘‘for some,’’ ‘‘there exists,’’ ‘‘there are,’’ and so on. For example, we may have the statements
For any integer x; x2 ¼ 1
and
There exists an integer x such that x2 ¼ 1:
Clearly the first statement is false, as is seen by taking x ¼ 3; however, the second statement
is true since we can take either x ¼ 1 or x ¼ #1.
If the context has been established that we are talking about integers, then the above
statements can safely be abbreviated as
For any x; x2 ¼ 1
and
There exists an x such that x2 ¼ 1:
The first statement involves the universal quantifier ‘‘for every,’’ and is making a
statement (here false) about all integers. The second statement involves the existential
quantifier ‘‘there exists,’’ and is making a statement (here true) about at least one integer.
These two quantifiers occur so often that mathematicians often use the symbol 8 to
stand for the universal quantifier, and the symbol 9 to stand for the existential quantifier.
That is,
8
9

denotes ‘‘for every; ’’
denotes ‘‘there exists:’’

While we do not use these symbols in this book, it is important for the reader to know how
to read formulas in which they appear. For example, the statement
ðiÞ

ð8xÞð9 yÞðx þ y ¼ 0Þ

(understood for integers) can be read
For every integer x; there exists
an integer y such that x þ y ¼ 0:
Similarly, the statement
ðiiÞ

ð9 yÞð8xÞðx þ y ¼ 0Þ

can be read
There exists an integer y; such that
for every integer x; then x þ y ¼ 0:
These two statements are very different; for example, the first one is true and the second
one is false. The moral is that the order of the appearance of the two different types of
quantifiers is very important. It must also be stressed that if several variables appear in a
mathematical expression with quantifiers, the values of the later variables should be
assumed to depend on all of the values of the variables that are mentioned earlier. Thus in
the (true) statement (i) above, the value of y depends on that of x; here if x ¼ 2, then y ¼ #2,
while if x ¼ 3, then y ¼ #3.

It is important that the reader understand how to negate a statement that involves
quantifiers. In principle, the method is simple.
(a) To show that it is false that every element x in some set possesses a certain property P,
it is enough to produce a single counter-example (that is, a particular element in the
set that does not possess this property); and
(b) To show that it is false that there exists an element y in some set that satisfies a certain
property P, we need to show that every element y in the set fails to have that property.
Therefore, in the process of forming a negation,
not ð8xÞP

becomes

ð9 xÞ not P

not ð9 yÞP

becomes

ð8yÞ not P:

and similarly,

When several quantifiers are involved, these changes are repeatedly used. Thus the negation of the (true) statement (i) given previously becomes in succession
not ð8 xÞð9 yÞðx þ y ¼ 0Þ;
ð9 xÞ not ð9 yÞðx þ y ¼ 0Þ;
ð9 xÞð8 yÞ not ðx þ y ¼ 0Þ;
ð9 xÞð8 yÞðx þ y 6¼ 0Þ:
The last statement can be rendered in words as:
There exists an integer x; such that
for every integer y; then x þ y 6¼ 0:
(This statement is, of course, false.)
Similarly, the negation of the (false) statement (ii) given previously becomes in
succession
not ð9 yÞð8 xÞðx þ y ¼ 0Þ;
ð8 yÞ not ð8 xÞðx þ y ¼ 0Þ;
ð8 yÞð9 xÞ not ðx þ y ¼ 0Þ;
ð8 yÞð9 xÞðx þ y 6¼ 0Þ:
The last statement is rendered in words as
For every integer y; there exists
an integer x such that x þ y 6¼ 0:
Note that this statement is true, and that the value (or values) of x that make x þ y 6¼ 0
depends on y, in general.
Similarly, the statement
For every d &gt; 0; the interval ð#d; dÞ
contains a point belonging to the set A;
can be seen to have the negation
There exists d &gt; 0 such that the interval
ð#d; dÞ does not contain any point in A:

The first statement can be symbolized
ð8 d &gt; 0Þð9 y 2 AÞðy 2 ð#d; dÞÞ;
and its negation can be symbolized by
ð 9 d &gt; 0 Þ ð 8 y 2 AÞ ð y 2
= ð#d; dÞÞ;
or by
ð9 d &gt; 0ÞðA \ ð#d; dÞ ¼ ;Þ:
It is the strong opinion of the authors that, while the use of this type of symbolism is
often convenient, it is not a substitute for thought. Indeed, the readers should ordinarily
reason for themselves what the negation of a statement is and not rely slavishly on
symbolism. While good notation and symbolism can often be a useful aid to thought, it can
never be an adequate replacement for thought and understanding.
Direct Proofs
Let P and Q be statements. The assertion that the hypothesis P of the implication P ) Q
implies the conclusion Q (or that P ) Q is a theorem) is the assertion that whenever the
hypothesis P is true, then Q is true.
The construction of a direct proof of P ) Q involves the construction of a string of
statements R1, R2, . . . , Rn such that
P ) R1 ;

R1 ) R2 ;

...;

Rn ) Q:

(The Law of the Syllogism states that if R1 ) R2 and R2 ) R3 are true, then R1 ) R3 is true.)
This construction is usually not an easy task; it may take insight, intuition, and considerable
effort. Often it also requires experience and luck.
In constructing a direct proof, one often works forward from P and backward from Q.
We are interested in logical consequences of P; that is, statements Q1, # # # ,Qk such that
P ) Qi. And we might also examine statements P1, . . . , Pr such that Pj ) Q. If we can
work forward from P and backward from Q so the string ‘‘connects’’ somewhere in the
middle, then we have a proof. Often in the process of trying to establish P ) Q one finds
that one must strengthen the hypothesis (i.e., add assumptions to P) or weaken the
conclusion (that is, replace Q by a nonequivalent consequence of Q).
Most students are familiar with ‘‘direct’’ proofs of the type described above, but we
will give one elementary example here. Let us prove the following theorem.
A.1 Theorem The square of an odd integer is also an odd integer.
If we let n stand for an integer, then the hypothesis is:
P : n is an odd integer:
The conclusion of the theorem is:
Q : n2 is an odd integer:
We need the definition of odd integer, so we introduce the statement
R1 : n ¼ 2k # 1 for some integer k:


BAPP01

APPENDIX A LOGIC AND PROOFS

355

Then we have P ) R1 . We want to deduce the statement n2 ¼ 2m # 1 for some integer m,
since this would imply Q. We can obtain this statement by using algebra:
R2 : n2 ¼ ð2k # 1Þ2 ¼ 4k2 # 4k þ 1;
#
#
R3 : n2 ¼ 4k2 # 4k þ 2 # 1;
#
#
R4 : n2 ¼ 2 2k2 # 2k þ 1 # 1:
If we let m ¼ 2k2 # 2k þ 1, then m is an integer (why?), and we have deduced the
statement
R5 : n2 ¼ 2m # 1:
Thus we have P ) R1 ) R2 ) R3 ) R4 ) R5 ) Q, and the theorem is proved.
Of course, this is a clumsy way to present a proof. Normally, the formal logic is
suppressed and the argument is given in a more conversational style with complete English
sentences. We can rewrite the preceding proof as follows.
Proof of A.1 Theorem. If n is an odd integer, then n ¼# 2k # 1 for some
integer k.
#
Then the square of n is given by n2 ¼ 4k2 # 4k þ 1 ¼ 2 2k2 # 2k þ 1 # 1. If we let
m ¼ 2k2 # 2k þ 1, then m is an integer (why?) and n2 ¼ 2m # 1. Therefore, n2 is an odd
integer.
Q.E.D.
At this stage, we see that we may want to make a preliminary argument to prove that
2k2 # 2k þ 1 is an integer whenever k is an integer. In this case, we could state and prove
this fact as a Lemma, which is ordinarily a preliminary result that is needed to prove a
theorem, but has little interest by itself.
Incidentally, the letters Q.E.D. stand for quod erat demonstrandum, which is Latin for
‘‘which was to be demonstrated.’’

Indirect Proofs
There are basically two types of indirect proofs: (i) contrapositive proofs, and (ii) proofs by
contradiction. Both types start with the assumption that the conclusion Q is false, in other
words, that the statement ‘‘not Q’’ is true.
(i)

Contrapositive proofs. Instead of proving P ) Q, we may prove its logically
equivalent contrapositive: not Q ) not P.

Consider the following theorem.
A.2 Theorem If n is an integer and n2 is even, then n is even.
The negation of ‘‘Q : n is even’’ is the statement ‘‘not Q : n is odd.’’ The hypothesis
‘‘P : n2 is even’’ has a similar negation, so that the contrapositive is the implication: If n is
odd, then n2 is odd. But this is exactly Theorem A.1, which was proved above. Therefore
this provides a proof of Theorem A.2.
The contrapositive proof is often convenient when the universal quantifier is involved,
for the contrapositive form will then involve the existential quantifier. The following
theorem is an example of this situation.
A.3 Theorem Let a # 0 be a real number. If, for every e &gt; 0, we have 0 # a &lt; e, then a ¼ 0.

APPENDIX A LOGIC AND PROOFS

Proof. If a ¼ 0 is false, then since a # 0, we must have a &gt; 0. In this case, if we choose
e0 ¼ 12 a, then we have e0 &gt; 0 and e0 &lt; a, so that the hypothesis 0 # a &lt; e for all e &gt; 0 is
false.
Q.E.D.
Here is one more example of a contrapositive proof.
A.4 Theorem If m, n are natural numbers such that m þ n # 20, then either m # 10 or
n # 10.
Proof. If the conclusion is false, then we have both m &lt; 10 and n &lt; 10. (Recall
De Morgan’s Law.) Then addition gives us m þ n &lt; 10 þ 10 ¼ 20, so that the hypothesis
is false.
Q.E.D.
Proof by contradiction. This method of proof employs the fact that if C is a contradiction
(i.e., a statement that is always false, such as ‘‘1 ¼ 0’’), then the two statements
ðP and ðnot QÞÞ ) C;

P)Q

are logically equivalent. Thus we establish P ) Q by showing that the statement (P and
(not Q)) implies a contradiction.
Q.E.D.
A.5 Theorem Let a &gt; 0 be a real number. If a &gt; 0, then 1/a &gt; 0.
Proof. We suppose that the statement a &gt; 0 is true and that the statement 1/a &gt; 0 is false.
Therefore, 1/a # 0. But since a &gt; 0 is true, it follows from the order properties of R that
að1=aÞ # 0. Since 1 ¼ að1=aÞ, we deduce that 1 # 0. However, this conclusion contradicts
the known result that 1 &gt; 0.
Q.E.D.
There are several classic proofs by contradiction (also known as reductio ad
absurdum) in the mathematical literature. One is the proof that there is no rational number
r that satisfies r2 ¼ 2. (This is Theorem 2.1.4 in the text.) Another is the proof of the
infinitude of primes, found in Euclid’s Elements. Recall that a natural number p is prime if
its only integer divisors are 1 and p itself. We will assume the basic results that each prime
number is greater than 1 and each natural number greater than 1 is either prime or divisible
by a prime.
A.6 Theorem (Euclid’s Elements, Book IX, Proposition 20.) There are infinitely many
prime numbers.
Proof. If we suppose by way of contradiction that there are finitely many prime numbers,
then we may assume that S ¼ fp1 ; . . .; pn g is the set of all prime numbers. We let
m ¼ p1 # # # pn , the product of all the primes, and we let q ¼ m þ 1. Since q &gt; pi for
all i, we see that q is not in S, and therefore q is not prime. Then there exists a prime p that is
a divisor of q. Since p is prime, then p ¼ pj for some j, so that p is a divisor of m. But if p
divides both m and q ¼ m þ 1, then p divides the difference q # m ¼ 1. However, this is
impossible, so we have obtained a contradiction.

FINITE AND COUNTABLE SETS

We will establish the results that were stated in Section 1.3 without proof. The reader
should refer to that section for the definitions.
The first result is sometimes called the ‘‘Pigeonhole Principle.’’ It may be interpreted
as saying that if m pigeons are put into n pigeonholes and if m &gt; n, then at least two
pigeons must share one of the pigeonholes. This is a frequently used result in combinatorial
analysis. It yields many useful consequences.
B.1 Theorem Let m; n 2 N with m &gt; n. Then there does not exist an injection from N m
into N n .
Proof. We will prove this by induction on n.
If n ¼ 1 and if g is any map of N m ðm &gt; 1Þ into N 1 , then it is clear that gð1Þ ¼ # # # ¼
gðmÞ ¼ 1, so that g is not injective.
Assume that k &gt; 1 is such that if m &gt; k, there is no injection from N m into N k . We
will show that if m &gt; k þ 1, there is no function h : N m ! N kþ1 that is an injection.
Case 1: If the range hðN m Þ # N k # N kþ1 , then the induction hypothesis implies that h is
not an injection of N m into N k , and therefore into N kþ1 .
Case 2: Suppose that hðN m Þ is not contained in N k . If more than one element in N m
is mapped into k þ 1, then h is not an injection. Therefore, we may assume that a single
p 2 N m is mapped into k þ 1 by h. We now define h1 : N m#1 ! N k by
#
hðqÞ
if q ¼ 1; . . . ; p # 1;
h1 ðqÞ :¼
hðq þ 1Þ if q ¼ p; . . . ; m # 1:
Since the induction hypothesis implies that h1 is not an injection into N k , it is easily seen
that h is not an injection into N kþ1 .
Q.E.D.
We now show that a finite set determines a unique number in N.
1.3.2 Uniqueness Theorem If S is a finite set, then the number of elements in S is a
unique number in N.
Proof. If the set S has m elements, there exists a bijection f 1 of N m onto S. If S also has n
elements, there exists a bijection f 2 of N n onto S. If m &gt; n, then (by Exercise 21
of Section 1.1) f #1
2 # f 1 , is a bijection of N m onto N n , which contradicts Theorem B.1.
If n &gt; m, then f #1
1 # f 2 is a bijection of N n onto N m , which contradicts Theorem B.1.
Therefore we have m ¼ n.
Q.E.D.
B.2 Theorem If n 2 N, there does not exist an injection from N into N n .
Proof. Assume that f : N ! N n is an injection, and let m :¼ n þ 1. Then the restriction of
Q.E.D.
f to N m # N is also an injection into N n . But this contradicts Theorem B.1.

APPENDIX B FINITE AND COUNTABLE SETS

1.3.3 Theorem The set N of natural numbers is an infinite set.
Proof. If N is a finite set, there exists some n 2 N and a bijection f of N n onto N. In this
case the inverse function f #1 is a bijection (and hence an injection) of N onto N n . But this
contradicts Theorem B.2.
Q.E.D.
We will next establish Theorem 1.3.8. In connection with the array displayed in
Figure 1.3.1, the function h was defined by hðm; nÞ ¼ cðm þ n # 2Þ þ m, where
cðkÞ ¼ 1 þ 2 þ # # # þ k ¼ 12 kðk þ 1Þ. We now prove that the function h is a bijection.
1.3.8 Theorem The set N # N is denumerable.
Proof. We will show that the function h is a bijection.
(a) We first show that h is injective. If ðm; nÞ 6¼ ðm0 ; n0 Þ, then either (i) m þ n 6¼
0
m þ n0 , or (ii) m þ n ¼ m0 þ n0 and m 6¼ m0 .
In case (i), we may suppose m þ n &lt; m0 þ n0 . Then, using formula (1), the fact that c
is increasing, and m0 &gt; 0, we have
hðm; nÞ ¼ c ðm þ n # 2Þ þ m # c ðm þ n # 2Þ þ ðm þ n # 1Þ
¼ c ðm þ n # 1Þ # c ðm0 þ n0 # 2Þ
&lt; c ðm0 þ n0 # 2Þ þ m0 ¼ hðm0 ; n0 Þ:
In case (ii), if m þ n ¼ m0 þ n0 and m 6¼ m0 , then
hðm; nÞ # m ¼ cðm þ n # 2Þ ¼ cðm0 þ n0 # 2Þ ¼ hðm0 ; n0 Þ # m0 ;
whence hðm; nÞ 6¼ hðm0 ; n0 Þ.
(b) Next we show that h is surjective.
Clearly hð1; 1Þ ¼ 1. If p 2 N with p 2, we will find a pair ðmp ; np Þ 2 N # N with
hðmp ; np Þ ¼ p. Since p &lt; c ðpÞ, then the set Ep :¼ fk 2 N : p # c ðkÞg is nonempty.
Using the Well-Ordering Property 1.2.1, we let kp &gt; 1 be the least element in Ep . (This
means that p lies in the kp th diagonal.) Since p 2, it follows from equation (1) that
c ðkp # 1Þ &lt; p # c ðkp Þ ¼ c ðkp # 1Þ þ kp :
Let mp :¼ p # c ðkp # 1Þ so that 1 # mp # kp , and let np :¼ kp # mp þ 1 so that 1 #
np # kp and mp þ np # 1 ¼ kn . Therefore,
hðmp ; np Þ ¼ cðmp þ np # 2Þ þ mp ¼ c ðkp # 1Þ þ mp ¼ p:
Thus h is a bijection and N # N is denumerable.

Q.E.D.

The next result is crucial in proving Theorems 1.3.9 and 1.3.10.
B.3 Theorem If A # N and A is infinite, there exists a function w : N ! A such that
wðn þ 1Þ &gt; wðnÞ n for all n 2 N. Moreover, w is a bijection of N onto A.
Proof. Since A is infinite, it is not empty. We will use the Well-Ordering Property 1.2.1 of
N to give a recursive definition of w.
Since A 6¼ 0, there is a least element of A, which we define to be wð1Þ; therefore,
wð1Þ 1.
Since A is infinite, the set A1 :¼ Anfwð1Þg is not empty, and we define wð2Þ to be least
element of A1 . Therefore wð2Þ &gt; wð1Þ 1, so that wð2Þ 2.

Suppose that w has been defined to satisfy wðn þ 1Þ &gt; wðnÞ n for n ¼ 1; . . . ; k # 1,
whence wðkÞ &gt; wðk # 1Þ k # 1 so that wðkÞ k. Since the set A is infinite, the set
Ak :¼ Anfwð1Þ; . . . ; wðkÞg
is not empty and we define wðk þ 1Þ to be the least element in Ak . Therefore wðk þ 1Þ &gt;
wðkÞ, and since wðkÞ k, we also have wðk þ 1Þ k þ 1. Therefore, w is defined on all
of N.
We claim that w is an injection. If m &gt; n, then m ¼ n þ r for some r 2 N. If
r ¼ 1, then wðmÞ ¼ wðn þ 1Þ &gt; wðnÞ. Suppose that wðn þ kÞ &gt; wðnÞ; we will show that
wðn þ ðk þ 1ÞÞ &gt; wðnÞ. Indeed, this follows from the fact that wðn þ ðk þ 1ÞÞ ¼ wððnþ
kÞ þ 1Þ &gt; wðn þ kÞ &gt; wðnÞ. Since wðmÞ &gt; wðnÞ whenever m &gt; n, it follows that w is an
injection.
~ :¼ AnwðNÞ is not empty,
We claim that w is a surjection of N onto A. If not, the set A
~
and we let p be the least element in A. We claim that p belongs to the set fwð1Þ; . . . ; wðpÞg.
Indeed, if this is not true, then
p 2 Anfwð1Þ; . . . ; wðpÞg ¼ Ap ;
so that wðp þ 1Þ, being the least element in Ap , must satisfy wðp þ 1Þ # p. But this
~ is empty and w is a surjection
contradicts the fact that wðp þ 1Þ &gt; wðpÞ p. Therefore A
onto A.
Q.E.D.
B.4 Theorem If A # N, then A is countable.
Proof. If A is finite, then it is countable, so it suffices to consider the case that A is infinite.
In this case, Theorem B.3 implies that there exists a bijection w of N onto A, so that A is
denumerable and, therefore, countable.
Q.E.D.
1.3.9 Theorem Suppose that S and T are sets and that T # S.
(a) If S is a countable set, then T is a countable set.
(b) If T is an uncountable set, then S is an uncountable set.
Proof. (a) If S is a finite set, it follows from Theorem 1.3.5(a) that T is finite, and
therefore countable. If S is denumerable, then there exists a bijection c of S onto N. Since
cðSÞ # N, Theorem B.4 implies that cðSÞ is countable. Since the restriction of c to T is a
bijection onto cðTÞ and cðTÞ # N is countable, it follows that T is also countable.
(b) This assertion is the contrapositive of the assertion in (a).

THE RIEMANN AND
LEBESGUE CRITERIA

We will give here proofs of the Riemann and Lebesgue Criteria for a function to be
Riemann integrable. First we will give the Riemann Criterion, which is interesting in itself,
and also leads to the more incisive Lebesgue Criterion.
C.1 Riemann Integrability Criterion Let f : ½a; b# ! R be bounded. Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(a) f 2 R½a; b#:
(b) For every e &gt; 0 there exists a partition P e such that if P_ 1 ; P_ 2 are any tagged
partitions having the same subintervals as P e , then
#

(c) For every e &gt; 0 there exists a partition P e ¼ fI i gni¼1 ¼ f½xi#1 ; xi #gni¼1 such that if
mi :¼ infff ðxÞ : x 2 I i g and M i :¼ supff ðxÞ : x 2 I i g then

Proof. ðaÞ ) ðbÞ Given e &gt; 0, let he &gt; 0 be as in the Cauchy Criterion 7.2.1, and let P e
be any partition with jjP e jj &lt; he . Then if P_ 1 ; P_ 2 are any tagged partitions with the same
subintervals as P e , then jjP_ 1 jj &lt; he and jjP_ 2 jj &lt; he and so (1) holds.
ðbÞ ) ðcÞ Given e &gt; 0, let P e ¼ fI i gni¼1 be a partition as in (b) and let mi and M i be
as in the statement of (c). Since mi is an infimum and M i is a supremum, there exist points ui

Q.E.D.

We have already seen that every continuous function on [a, b] is Riemann integrable.
We also saw in Example 7.1.7 that Thomae’s function is Riemann integrable. Since
Thomae’s function has a countable set of points of discontinuity, it is evident that
continuity is not a necessary condition for Riemann integrability. Indeed, it is reasonable
to ask ‘‘how discontinuous’’ a function may be, yet still be Riemann integrable. The
Riemann Criterion throws some light on that question in showing that sums of the form
(2) must be arbitrarily small. Since the terms ðM i # mi Þðxi # xi#1 Þ in this sum are all # 0, it
follows that each of these terms must be small. Such a term will be small if (i) the difference
M i # mi is small (which will be the case if the function is continuous on the interval ½xi#1 ; xi #)
or if (ii) an interval where the difference M i # mi is not small has small length.
The Lebesgue Criterion, which we will discuss next, makes these ideas more precise.
But first it is convenient to have the notion of the oscillation of a function.
C.2 Definition Let f : A ! R be a bounded function. If S # A # R, we define the
oscillation of f on S to be
ð3Þ

Wð f ; SÞ :¼ supfj f ðxÞ # f ðyÞj : x; y 2 Sg:
It is easily seen that we can also write
Wð f ; SÞ ¼ supf f ðxÞ # f ðyÞ : x; y 2 Sg
¼ supf f ðxÞ : x 2 Sg # inff f ðxÞ : x 2 Sg:

It is also trivial that if S # T # A, then
0 # Wð f ; SÞ # Wð f ; TÞ # 2 # supfj f ðxÞj : x 2 Ag:
If r &gt; 0, we recall that the r-neighborhood of c 2 A is the set
V r ðcÞ :¼ fx 2 A : jx # cj &lt; rg:
C.3 Definition If c 2 A, we define the oscillation of f at c by
ð4Þ

wð f ; cÞ :¼ inffWð f ; V r ðcÞÞ : r &gt; 0g ¼ lim Wð f ; V r ðcÞÞ:
r!0þ

Since r 7! Wð f ; V r ðcÞÞ is an increasing function for r &gt; 0, this right-hand limit exists and
equals the indicated infimum.

APPENDIX C THE RIEMANN AND LEBESGUE CRITERIA

C.4 Lemma If f : A ! R is bounded and c 2 A, then f is continuous at c if and only if
the oscillation wð f ; cÞ ¼ 0.
Proof. ð)Þ If f is continuous at c, given e &gt; 0 there exists d &gt; 0 such that if x 2 V r ðcÞ,
then j f ðxÞ # f ðcÞj &lt; e=2. Therefore, if x; y 2 V r ðcÞ, we have j f ðxÞ # f ðyÞj &lt; e, whence
0 # wð f ; cÞ # Wð f ; V r ðcÞÞ # e. Since e &gt; 0 is arbitrary, this implies that wð f ; cÞ ¼ 0.
ð(Þ If wð f ; cÞ ¼ 0 and e &gt; 0, there exists s &gt; 0 with Wð f ; V s ðcÞÞ &lt; e. Thus, if jx # cj
&lt; s then j f ðxÞ # f ðcÞj &lt; e, and f is continuous at c.
Q.E.D.
We will now give the details of the proof of the Lebesgue Integrability Criterion. First
we recall the statement of the theorem.
Lebesgue’s Integrability Criterion A bounded function f : ½a; b# ! R is Riemann
integrable if and only if it is continuous almost everywhere on [a, b].
Proof. ð)Þ Let e &gt; 0 be given and, for each k 2 N, let H k :¼ fx 2 ½a; b# : wð f ; xÞ &gt;
1=2k g. We will show that H k is contained in the union of a finite number of intervals having total
length &lt; e=2k .
nðkÞ
By the Riemann Criterion, there is a partition P k ¼ f½xki#1 ; xki #gi¼1 such that if mki
(respectively, M ki ) is the infimum (respectively, supremum) of f on the interval ½xki#1 ; xki #, then
nðkÞ

ðM ki # mki Þðxki # xki#1 Þ &lt; e=4k :

If x 2 H k \ ðxki#1 ; xki Þ, there exists r &gt; 0 such that V r ðxÞ # ðxki#1 ; xki Þ, whence
1=2k # wð f ; xÞ # Wð f ; V r ðxÞÞ # M ki # mki :
If we denote a summation over those i with H k \ ðxki#1 ; xki Þ 6¼ ; by

ðM ki # mki Þðxki # xki#1 Þ # e=4k ;

ðxki # xki#1 Þ # e=2k :

Since H k differs from the union of sets H k \ ðxki # xki#1 Þ by at most a finite number of the
partition points, we conclude that H k is contained in the union of a finite number of intervals
with total length &lt; e=2k .
S
Finally, since D :¼ fx 2 ½a; b# : wð f ; xÞ &gt; 0g ¼ 1
k¼1 H k , it follows that the set D of
points of discontinuity of f 2 R½a; b# is a null set.
(() Let j f ðxÞj # M for x 2 ½a; b# and suppose that the set D of points of discontinuity of f is a null

Thus we have defined a gauge d on [a, b]. If P_ ¼ fð½xi#1 ; xi #; ti Þgni¼1 is a d-fine partition

Sd :¼ fi : ti 2 Dg:

If P_ is d-fine, we have ½xi#1 ; xi # # V dðti Þ ðti Þ, whence it follows that M i # mi # M ti # mti .
Consequently, if i 2 Sc then M i # mi # e, while if i 2 Sd we have M i # mi # 2M.

APPROXIMATE INTEGRATION

We will supply here the proofs of Theorems 7.5.3, 7.5.6, and 7.5.8. We will not repeat the
statement of these results, and we will use the notations introduced in Section 7.5 and refer
to numbered equations there. It will be seen that some important results from Chapters 5
and 6 are used in these proofs.
Proof of Theorem 7.5.3. If k ¼ 1, 2, . . . , n, let ak : ¼ a þ (k # 1)h and let wk : ½0; h# ! R

w00k ðtÞ ¼ # 12 f 0 ðak þ tÞ þ 12 f 0 ðak þ tÞ þ 12 tf 00 ðak þ tÞ

Now let A, B be defined by

so that we have 12 At # w00k ðtÞ # 12 Bt for t 2 ½0; h#; k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n. Integrating and applying

APPENDIX E

TWO EXAMPLES

In this appendix we will give an example of a continuous function that has a derivative at no
point and of a continuous curve in R 2 whose range contains the entire unit square of R 2 .
Both proofs use the Weierstrass M-Test 9.4.6.
A Continuous Nowhere Differentiable Function
The example we will give is a modification of one due to B. L. van der Waerden in 1930.
Let f 0 : R ! R be defined by f 0 ðxÞ :¼ distðx; ZÞ ¼ inf fjx # kj : k 2 Zg, so that f0 is a
continuous ‘‘sawtooth’’ function whose graph consists of lines with slope #1 on the
intervals ½k=2; ðk þ 1Þ=2#, k 2 Z. For each m 2 N, let f m ðxÞ :¼ ð1=4m Þ f 0 ð4m xÞ, so that fm
is also a continuous sawtooth function whose graph consists of lines with slope #1 and
with 0 # f m ðxÞ # 1=ð2 # 4m Þ. (See Figure E.1.)

Figure E.1

Graphs of f0, f1, and f2.

We now define g : R ! R by gðxÞ :¼

1
X
m¼0

f m ðxÞ. The Weierstrass M-Test implies that

the series is uniformly convergent on R; hence g is continuous on R. We will now show that
g is not differentiable at any point of R.
Fix x 2 R. For each n 2 N, let hn :¼ #1=4nþ1 , with the sign chosen so that both 4nx
and 4n ðx þ hn Þ lie in the same interval [k/2, (k þ 1)/2]. Since f0 has slope #1 on this
interval, then
en :¼

f n ðx þ hn Þ # f n ðxÞ f 0 ð4n x þ 4n hn Þ # f 0 ð4n xÞ

¼ #1:

4n hn

In fact if m &lt; n, then the graph of fm also has slope #1 on the interval between x and x þ hn
and so
em :¼

f m ðx þ hn Þ # f m ðxÞ

hn

for

m &lt; n:

APPENDIX E TWO EXAMPLES

On the other hand, if m &gt; n, then 4m ðx þ hn Þ # 4m x ¼ #4m#n#1 is an integer, and since f0
has period equal to 1, it follows that
f m ðx þ hn Þ # f m ðxÞ ¼ 0:
Consequently, we have
n
n
gðx þ hn Þ # gðxÞ X
f m ðx þ hn Þ # f m ðxÞ X
¼
¼
em ;
hn
hn
m¼0
m¼0

whence the difference quotient (g(x þ hn) # g(x))=hn is an odd integer if n is even, and an
even integer if n is odd. Therefore, the limit
gðx þ hÞ # gðxÞ
h!0
h
lim

does not exist, so g is not differentiable at the arbitrary point x 2 R.
A Space-Filling Curve
We will now give an example of a space-filling curve that was constructed by I. J. Schoenberg
in 1938. Let w : R ! R be the continuous, even function with period 2 given by
8
for 0 # t # 1=3;
&gt;
&lt;0
wðtÞ :¼ 3t # 1 for 1=3 &lt; t &lt; 2=3;

for 2=3 # t # 1:

Since 0 # wðxÞ # 1 and is continuous, the Weierstrass M-Test implies that f and g are
continuous on [0, 1]; moreover, 0 # f ðtÞ # 1 and 0 # gðtÞ # 1. We will now show that an
arbitrary point (x0, y0) in [0, 1] # [0, 1] is the image under ( f, g) of some point t0 2 [0, 1].
Indeed, let x0 and y0 have the binary (¼ base 2) expansions:
a0 a2 a4
a1 a3 a5
x0 ¼ þ 2 þ 3 þ # # #
and
y0 ¼ þ 2 þ 3 þ # # # ;
2 2
2 2

where each ak equals 0 or 1. It will be shown that x0 ¼ f (t0) and y0 ¼ g(t0), where t0 has the
ternary (¼ base 3) expansion
t0 ¼

First, we note that the above formula does yield a number in [0, 1]. We also note that if a0 ¼ 0,
then 0 # t0 # 1=3 so that wðt0 Þ ¼ 0, and if a0 ¼ 1, then 2/3 # t0 # 1 so that wðt0 Þ ¼ 1;
therefore, in both cases wða0 Þ ¼ a0 . Similarly, it is seen that for each n 2 N there exists
mn 2 N such that
3n t0 ¼ 2mn þ

HINTS FOR SELECTED EXERCISES

Reader: Do not look at these hints unless you are stymied. However, after putting a
considerable amount of thought into a problem, sometimes just a little hint is all that is
needed. Many of the exercises call for proofs, and there is usually no single approach that is
correct, so even if you have a totally different argument, yours may be correct. Very few of
the following hints give much detail, and some may seem downright cryptic at first.
Somewhat more detail is presented for the earlier material.
Section 1.1
1.

(a) {5, 11, 17}

3. Show that if A # B, then A ¼ A \ B. Next show that if A ¼ A \ B, then A # B.
4. Show that if x 2 AnðB \ C Þ, then x 2 ðAnBÞ [ ðAnCÞ. Next show that if y 2 ðAnBÞ [ ðAnC Þ,
then y 2 AnðB \ CÞ. Since the sets AnðB \ C Þ and AnðB \ CÞ contain the same elements, they
are equal.
7. (a) A1 \ A2 ¼ f6; 12; 18; 24; . . .g ¼ f6k : k 2 N g ¼ A5 :
(b) [ An ¼ Nnf1g and \ An ¼ ;:
9. No. For example, both (0, 1) and (0, #1) belong to C.
11. (a) f ðEÞ ¼ ½2; 3#; so hðEÞ ¼ gð f ðEÞÞ ¼ gð½2; 3#Þ ¼ ½4; 9#:
(b) g#1 ðGÞ ¼ ½#2; 2#; so h#1 ðGÞ ¼ ½#4; 0#:
15. If x 2 f #1 ðGÞ \ f #1 ðH Þ, then x 2 f #1 ðGÞ and x 2 f #1 ðH Þ, so that f ðxÞ 2 G and f ðxÞ 2 H. Then
f ðxÞ 2 G \ H, and hence x 2 f #1 ðG \ H Þ. This shows that f #1 ðGÞ \ f #1 ðH Þ # f #1 ðG \ H Þ:
17. One possibility is f ðxÞ :¼ ðx # aÞ=ðb # aÞ.
21. If gð f ðx1 ÞÞ ¼ gð f ðx2 ÞÞ, then f ðx1 Þ ¼ f ðx2 Þ, so that x1 ¼ x2 , which implies that g # f is
injective. If w 2 C, there exists y 2 B such that gðyÞ ¼ w, and there exists x 2 A such that
f ðxÞ ¼ y. Then gð f ðxÞÞ ¼ w, so that g # f is surjective. Thus g # f is a bijection.
22. (a) If f ðx1 Þ ¼ f ðx2 Þ, then gð f ðx1 ÞÞ ¼ gð f ðx2 ÞÞ, which implies x1 ¼ x2 , since g # f is injective.
Thus f is injective.

1. Use Exercise 1.1.21 (¼ Exercise 21 of Section 1.1).
2. Part (b) Let f be a bijection of N m onto A and let C ¼ f f ðkÞg for some k 2 N m . Define g on
N m#1 by gðiÞ :¼ f ðiÞ for i ¼ 1; . . . ; k # 1, and gðiÞ :¼ f ði þ 1Þ for i ¼ k; . . . ; m # 1. Then g is a

20. (a) Use 2.1.7(c).
21. (a) Let S :¼ fn 2 N : 0 &lt; n &lt; 1g. If S is not empty, the Well-Ordering Property of N implies
there is a least element m in S. However, 0 &lt; m &lt; 1 implies that 0 &lt; m2 &lt; m, and since
m2 is also in S, this is a contradiction of the fact that m is the least element of S.

bound of S1 because v=2 2 S1 and v=2 &lt; v. Therefore inf S1 ¼ 0.

an upper bound of A and of B, so that u # z and v # z. Hence w # z. Therefore,
w ¼ supðA [ BÞ.

Section 2.4
1. Since 1 # 1=n &lt; 1 for all n 2 N, 1 is an upper bound. To show that 1 is the supremum, it must be

F ðx0 Þ ¼ supfhðx0 ; yÞ : y 2 Y g, whence there exists y0 2 Y with w &lt; hðx0 ; y0 Þ. Thus w is not an

w &lt; supfF ðxÞ : x 2 X g, we conclude that supfF ðxÞ : x 2 X g # sup S.

Hence g 2

then the argument in 10.4.6(d) shows that E is continuous at t0 . Also, if tk # 1, then
jðe#tk x sin xÞ=xj # e#x and the Dominated Convergence Theorem implies that Eðtk Þ ! 0.
Thus EðtÞ ! 0 as t ! 1.

(d) We do not know that E is continuous as t ! 0þ.
12. Fix x 2 I. As in 10.4.6(e), if t; t0 2 ½a; b#, there exists tx between t; t0 such that f ðt; xÞ#

Therefore aðxÞ # ½ f ðt; xÞ # f ðt0 ; xÞ#=ðt # t0 Þ # vðxÞ when

t 6¼ t0 . Now argue as before and use the Dominated Convergence Theorem 10.4.5.
13. (a) If ðsk Þ is a sequence of step functions converging to f a.e., and ðtk Þ is a sequence of step
functions converging to g a.e., Theorem 10.4.9(a) and Exercise 2.2.18 imply that
ðmaxfsk ; tk gÞ is a sequence of step functions that converges to maxf f ; gg a.e. Similarly,
for minf f ; gg.
14. (a) Since f k 2 M½a; b# is bounded, it belongs to R ½a; b#. The Dominated Convergence
Theorem implies that f 2 R ½a; b#. The Measurability Theorem 10.4.11 now implies that
f 2 M½a; b#.
(b) Since t 7! Arctan t is continuous, Theorem 10.4.9(b) implies that f k :¼ Arctan # gk 2

(c) If gk ! g a.e., it follows from the continuity of Arctan that f k ! f a.e. Parts (a, b)
imply that f 2 M½a; b# and Theorem 10.4.9(b) applied to w ¼ tan implies that

(e) If ðEk Þ is an increasing sequence in M ½a; b#, then ð1Ek Þ is an increasing sequence in

3. Since the union of two open sets is open, then G1 [ # # # [ Gk [ Gkþ1 ¼ ðG1 [ # # # [ Gk Þ [
Gkþ1 is open.
5. The complement of N is the union ð#1; 1Þ [ ð1; 2Þ [ # # # of open intervals.
7. Corollary 2.4.9 implies that every neighborhood of x in Q contains a point not in Q .
10. x is a boundary point of A() every neighborhood V of x contains points in A and points in
CðaÞ()x is a boundary point of CðaÞ.
12. The sets F and C(F) have the same boundary points. Therefore F contains all of its boundary
points () C ðF Þ does not contain any of its boundary points () C ðF Þ is open.
13. x 2 A# () x belongs to an open set V # A()x is an interior point of A.
15. Since A# is the intersection of all closed sets containing A, then by 11.1.5(a) it is a closed set
containing A. Since CðA# Þ is open, then z 2 CðA# Þ () z has a neighborhood V e ðzÞ in
CðA# Þ () z is neither an interior point nor a boundary point of A.
19. If G 6¼ ; is open and x 2 G, then there exists e &gt; 0 such that V e ðxÞ # G, whence it follows that
a :¼ x # e is in Ax .
21. If ax &lt; y &lt; x then since ax :¼ inf Ax there exists a0 2 Ax such that ax &lt; a0 # y. Therefore
ðy; x# # ða0 ; x# # G and y 2 G.
23. If x 2 F and n 2 N, the interval I n in F n containing x has length 1=3n . Let yn be an endpoint of I n

24. As in the preceding exercise, take zn to be the midpoint of I n . Then zn 2

3. Let Gn :¼ ð1=2n; 2Þ for n 2 N.
5. If G1 is an open cover of K 1 and G2 is an open cover of K 2 , then G1 [ G2 is an open cover of

7. Let K n :¼ ½0; n# for n 2 N.
10. Since K 6¼ ; is bounded, it follows that inf K exists in R. If K n :¼ fk 2 K : k # ðinf K Þ þ 1=ng,
then K n is closed and bounded, hence compact. By the preceding exercise \K n 6¼ ;, but if

8. Let f be the Dirichlet Discontinuous Function.

A () x 2
= f #1 ðAÞ () x 2 Rnf #1 ðAÞ; therefore, f #1 ðRnAÞ ¼ Rn f #1 ðAÞ. Now use the fact that a
set F # R is closed if and only if RnF is open, together with Corollary 11.3.3.

Section 11.4
1. If Pi :¼ ðxi ; yi Þ for i ¼ 1; 2; 3, then d 1 ðP1 ; P2 Þ # ðjx1 # x3 jþjx3 # x2 jÞþðjy1 # y3 jþ
jy3 # y2 jÞ ¼ d 1 ðP1 ; P3 Þ þ d 1 ðP3 ; P2 Þ. Thus d 1 satisfies the Triangle Inequality.
2. Since j f ðxÞ # gðxÞj # j f ðxÞ # hðxÞj þ jhðxÞ # gðxÞj # d 1 ð f ; hÞ þ d 1 ðh; gÞ for all x 2 ½0; 1#,
it follows that d 1 ð f ; gÞ # d 1 ð f ; hÞ þ d 1 ðh; gÞ and d 1 satisfies the Triangle Inequality.
3. We have s 6¼ t if and only if d ðs; tÞ ¼ 1. If s 6¼ t, the value of d ðs; uÞ þ d ðu; tÞ is either 1 or 2
depending on whether u equals s or t, or neither.
4. Since d 1 ðPn ; PÞ ¼ supfjxn # xj; jyn # yjg, if d 1 ðPn ; PÞ ! 0 then it follows that both
jxn # xj ! 0 and jyn # yj ! 0, whence xn ! x and yn ! y. Conversely, if xn ! x and
yn ! y, then jxn # xj ! 0 and jyn # yj ! 0, whence d 1 ðPn ; PÞ ! 0.
6. If a sequence ðxn Þ in S converges to x relative to the discrete metric d, then d ðxn ; xÞ ! 0, which
implies that xn ¼ x for all sufficiently large n. The converse is trivial.
7. Show that a set consisting of a single point is open. Then it follows that every set is an open set,
so that every set is also a closed set. (Why?)
10. Let G # S2 be open in ðS2 ; d 2 Þ and let x 2 f #1 ðGÞ so that f ðxÞ 2 G. Then there exists an
e-neighborhood V e ð f ðxÞÞ # G. Since f is continuous at x, there exists a d-neighborhood Vd(x)
such that f (Vd(x)) # Ve( f(x)). Since x 2 f #1 ðGÞ is arbitrary, we conclude that f #1 ðGÞ is open in
ðS1 ; d 1 Þ. The proof of the converse is similar.
11. Let G ¼ fGa g be a cover of f ðSÞ # R by open sets in#R. It follows
# from 11.4.11 that each set
f #1 ðGa Þ is open in ðS; d Þ. Therefore, the
collection f #1 ðGa Þ #is an open cover of S. Since
# #1
ðS; d Þ is compact, a finite subcollection f ðGa1 Þ; . . . ; f #1 ðGaN Þ covers S, whence it follows
that the sets fGa1 ; . . . ; GaN g must form a finite subcover of G for f (S). Since G was an arbitrary
open cover of f (S), we conclude that f (S) is compact.
